This is a great guitar hanger that was recommended to me by several people. Great for people with babies/toddlers looking to get their guitars off the ground like myself.I love the unique self-locking mechanism that it has. The weight of the guitar lowers the hanger and moves the lock levers up so your guitar neck is securely fastened. I have an electric and an acoustic hanging up. The acousitc's body is about 4.5" thick and has plenty of clearance from the wall when hung. The electric I think weights around 8 pounds and it held no problem by the Hercules hook. I believe the max weight it can hold is about 15lbs.I only installed into studs and wouldn't really want to try a drywall-only installation. The product does come with drywall anchors but many of the reviewers said the included drywall anchors are cheap and not that good. The wood screws that came with the product I found to be a little short (if you were installing on dry-wall in front of a stud). Others found this to be true too. I bought #8 Wood Screws in 2.5" length at the hardware store and these worked perfectly for my install. The included screws I  think are about 2" in length or a little less.
