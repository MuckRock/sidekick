Not sure if these are more on the brass side or the bronze? Not really to my liking compared to the phospher bronze. The EXPs are nice strings. They have a nice feel to them along with less string noise. And they last. My two acoustic  guitars, a Takamine Mini jumbo and a Gretsch jumbo, both made from mahogany are both nice sounding guitars. I figured i would try these 80/20 strings after using phospher bronze. Only real problem i noticed is the 80/20s seem brighter and they ring longer. I prefer the warmer tone. And since my guitars have alot of "boom" already, i dont need the extra ring to complicate the sound with overtones when strumming fast. I imagine these strings may work in some instances, but i am going back to the phospher bronze for my guitars.
