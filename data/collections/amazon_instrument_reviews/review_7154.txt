This portable 9volt amp is pretty loud without sacrificing tone. It's way louder than a 9volt Fender mini Twin (which actually does incorporate two speakers), however when you dial in the gain all the way you get a crunch rather than full on distortion. It comes included with a 9volt and is compatible with most negative tip power adapters (make sure its 300mA like the Planetwaves adapter for $9.00). At $20.00 this amp is a deal!
