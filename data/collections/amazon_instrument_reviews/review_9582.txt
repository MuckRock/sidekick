I was hesitant to purchase this, as I really like the display of the previous models. At first it seems like it might be less accurate. It has less granularity in the display for example. However, it does seem to respond noticeably faster. It appears to be a bit more sensitive and better at tuning bass notes. And it may in fact be more precise, though it takes learning how to work with the display.On earlier Snarks, the display has individual tiny gradients for each cent of pitch above or below the note. And they seemed pretty dead on, especially if you tune from the harmonic at the middle of the string. But I also found that the note would occasionally stall briefly causing me to over-tune. (Though once you get used to it, it is easily avoided.)Anyway, on this unit, I am not sure what each bar represents, but it is very sensitive. If the string is not quite perfect, the "On pitch" bar will be lit up, but so will one next to it. Then a slight turn of the tuning peg will bring it right on. Then only the "On pitch" bar will be lit (unless you turn too far). And the result sounds really right.
