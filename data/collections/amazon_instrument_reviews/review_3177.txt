This is my second Fender Polish Cloth. They are basic, but that's all I need for a quick wipe down of my instrument after I'm done playing. The only slight negative is the fact that they tend to unravel around the edges. Even though this has happened to me, it didn't keep me from buying the second one. The fact that they are basic and inexpensive is good enough for me. It gets softer with time and use. Overall I have to say that I'm satisfied with the Fender Polish Cloth.
