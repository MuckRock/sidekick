This comes with adapters for just about any pedal you would need power for and if you look at the picture, I LOVE the way this mounts to power strip.  You can actually put several (if needed) side by side, unlike most other power adapters that take up as much as 2 spaces.  It is rated to 1700 mA but I try to keep to 1500 or less.I looked at power requirements of all my pedals and combined accordingly.
