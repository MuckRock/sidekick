I just bought this amp for my Epiphone Goth Studio guitar, I've got it this weekend and I'm very satisfied with this product. I'm not a proffessional but this amp is really good for the price you pay as it comes with so many functions, with complete add-ons on th webpage. Solid, nice sound, very good quality to make anyone happy, except your neighbors.Now after a couple of months I want to say... this is great product in terms of sound, not so great in terms of small building detailsGreat for Blues style, just use it with clean and good reverb or crunch  and you will get amazing blues sounds.My only con and that's why I have reduced it to 4 stars is the fact that one of the corners protectors came broken and also, the Phones are not working. Better quality control at the plant can avoid this things to happen. I wrote to Line6 and I got useless answers about.
