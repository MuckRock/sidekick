I've purchased a couple of of the blue 25 foot mic cords from this seller before - same as these.  I've had them for well over a year used in live music at least 5 times a month.  They've been stepped on, and treated pretty rough.  They are still supple and easy to wind up.  In contrast; I have other mic cords from a different manufacturer and the set screws have fallen out, they are stiffer and just haven't held up as well.  Having the multicolor cords makes it a lot easier to see which channel on the mixer is connected to which mic.  Very inexpensive yet reliable cord.  Highly recommended.
