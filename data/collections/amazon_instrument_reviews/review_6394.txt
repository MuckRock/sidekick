This microphone's quality is amazing. I just hooked it up to my PC (Windows 7) and it worked no hassle whatsoever. Nothing to install or hoops to jump through, just works great. I recommend buying a mic stand of some kind if you really want to eliminate vibration or other background noises. The stand that comes with it is very stable, but it is low to the ground (or in this case, desk/table) so it may pick up some unwanted background noise (computer fans, mouse clicks/movement, etc).
