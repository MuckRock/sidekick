I own alot of MXR pedals and this one is one of my favorites. This is one of the top delay pedals the pro's use. It is super simple to use, Regen is how many repeats you want, Delay is how long you want the delay to be and the Mix is basically how loud you want delay to be in your mix. You can get all the great delays out of this one pedal. From Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love, to the Randy Rhoads solos of the 80's. There is also a little MOD button which seems to add some depth to the pedal, really makes it seem a bit fuller. I like that feature alot.
