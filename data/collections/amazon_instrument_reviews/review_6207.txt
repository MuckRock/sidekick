I have owned many delay pedals in the past several decades.I like this one the best...especially for the price range.Boss DD-7 beats the pants off the Line 6 Echo Park delay. The Echo Park delay causes a little noise/interference when not used, being caused by the little LED light flashing...you can hear it buzz each time it flashes through the amp. The Boss DD-7 was perfectly clean and did not alter the tone.Many great features including an on-the-fly sampler/looper.The ability to control it with an external pedal/switch.Easy to set and adjust while playing live and on-the-fly.Matches perfectly with other Boss pedals.Standard "Built Like A Tank" Boss construction is renowned for.It also beats the other Boss Delay pedals available for quality, sound and features.Many options, settings and configuration choices makes this pedal versatile.I bought this for quality, ease of use and straightforward operation while playing live.It also "self-oscillates & freaks out" quite well. (If you're into that sort of thing!)Make sure you read the instruction and settings operation manual. There are "new" operations and ways to "set" this pedal up to perform certain functions.
