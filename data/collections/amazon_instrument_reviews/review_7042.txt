This mic has a very solid construction and looks and feels like a SM57.  I liked what it did to live vocals vs an old mic I have that seemed to give everyone small shocks (and probably cost way more in the day).  I originally bought this to check the hype out and can say that I will likely get more as needed instead of buying SM57s.  I have not recorded with this yet, but from what I heard online, I think it will do just fine.
