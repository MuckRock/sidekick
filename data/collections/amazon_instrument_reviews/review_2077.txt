Hey jerks, do you play guitar?  Well, if you do, you need strings.  Well, you could be an experimental guitarist playing a stringless guitar.  If so, you can stop reading.  If you use strings, you should buy them your damn self.  While you're at it, buy ten sets.  Seriously, are you a child?  Always have extra strings.  D'Addarios last a long time for me, and they sound good.  Also, they're on the bottom end of the price range.  Buy some strings, douchnozzle.
