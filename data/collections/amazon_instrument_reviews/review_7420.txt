I am not an avid player but it fits good and for the price you can not beat it.  I thought it would not be as good but wow my surprise to it and the fit I have a 4/4 Violin I think handed down from my ggggrandfather the violin is so old can hardly tell what kind it is someone once told me it was one of those stratovariouses tempted to throw it out a couple of times but it is sentimental since it came from and handed down through the family, should just pitch the thing but now I do have a nice shoulder comforter.  Will definitely keep the shoulder thing even if I do pitch the violin for a nice shiney new one.
