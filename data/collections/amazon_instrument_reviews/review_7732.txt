For whatever reason I excpected the tin to be a little larger then what it is.  I thought the size of an Altoid tin.  I was thinking I could not only store the fifteen Beatles picks, but also store my hundred other picks in the tin.It is very nice looking tin and the picks are cool,  well worth the just under $8.00 price tag. I may order another one with different print on the tin, but it is a small tin.  Just a little larger than a zippo lighter.
