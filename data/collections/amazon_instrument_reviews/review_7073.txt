Fender original parts can't be beat. The Philips head is an improvement over the &#34;vintage&#34; straight slot screw that a screwdriver can slip out of and scratch the finish. These look like the have a nickel plating and I believe are 8-18, or 6-18 size screw and are much cheaper at a hardware store, but I chose Fender original parts for the Tele I recently finished and for the one I am currently working on.
