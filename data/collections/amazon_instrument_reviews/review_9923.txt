Looked at a lot of cases most priced $90 or above.  Settled on this one because of price, reviews, and measurements posted here in the reviews that assured my my guitar would fit.  I have an Alvarez AD60 (dreadnaught style body) and it fits in this case nice and snug.  Solid, well padded, sturdy latches, and everything lines up.  Very happy with my purchase.
