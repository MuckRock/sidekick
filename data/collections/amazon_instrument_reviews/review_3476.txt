This is my first time using a hybrid mix and ti does take some getting used to but I enjoy the heavier bass sounds it provides while maintain easy to bend higher strings. Installed with no problems, plays pretty well so far. It stays in tune pretty well, it's still the first day and the pitch is holding well.
