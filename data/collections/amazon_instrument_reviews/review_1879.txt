Not happy with the sellers description or the product. The description says "Heavy Duty" which makes you assume that it's a regular hard plastic Mic Clip, but it's not. IT'S RUBBER!!! It sucks. Used it a couple times and it's hard to slide the mic in and I can see after a couple more uses how it's probably going to need to be taped because the swivel will become very loos cause the rubber will wear down quickly, and flex. IT'S FLEXIBLE!!! Who uses Flexible Mic Clips?!!! Make sure you don't buy this and get a hard plastic clip instead.
