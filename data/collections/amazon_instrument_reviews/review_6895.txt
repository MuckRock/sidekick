I'm an enthusiastic amateur, which means I care about my gear, but it's not my living. I buy the best gear i can afford, but I can't go all Mogami for every cable I need. Planet Waves is dependable durable stuff at prices the weekend warrior  can pay.  These sound good (by that I mean they don't have any sound at all!), and are made well. The design is such that they will wear well. I'm very pleased with these.
