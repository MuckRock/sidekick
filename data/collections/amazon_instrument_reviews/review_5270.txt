I bought a tusq nut and this tusq saddle for an Aria acoustic which can be a nice sounding guitar. The difference is quite noticeable and good. The guitar is a modest model but it is a player with a "better than a lot more expensive guitars" sound. I had a bone nut that cracked which is why I tried these replacements. In my estimation the sound is clearer, brighter and louder. The price seemed high for a little chunk of "plastic" but the difference in sound leaves me satisfied.
