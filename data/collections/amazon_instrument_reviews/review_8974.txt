Having purchased many &#34;A&#34; frame and more &#34;traditional&#34; style stands, this one has quickly become my favorite. Not only is the padding much better than the rest of them, this thing is very sturdy and the casters actually work. Only thing lacking a bit is the instructions, but it's easy enough to put together that they aren't really needed. I'll probably be buying a second one for the rest of my guitars soon.
