Whatever the name, this pedal is from the Ibanez Tube Screamer camp. The packaging description says it uses the JRC4558 chip and MA150 diodes, and yes, Behringer got the sound right. I'd say this competes well against any of the modded TS pedals. What I love about this pedal is the TONE knob. For the TS pedals in this price range, it's the most useful. You can set it high, and it isn't too icepicky, yet the entire range is useful. This is great if you use the thing as your main overdrive sound.I prefer this pedal for boosting my gain in a hot amp or pedal, or another overdrive. It works well as a lead boost for rock or blues tones. It could also be used to add a touch of breakup for jazz tones.I bought this pedal to "semi-retire" an older Ibanez TS5 soundtank. The switch on that one isn't as good as the Behringer's. The Behringer has a much smoother action to it when turning the pedal on or off. I use mainly solid state Fender amps, and several distortion pedals (including a BOSS Metal Zone). I'd bet this would sound great through any tube amp worth its salt. The only downside is the slight lack of bass. If you routinely run your guitar sound through 12 inch speaker setups (esp. 2x12 and 4x12), or a distorted tone with plenty of bass, this shouldn't be a problem.
