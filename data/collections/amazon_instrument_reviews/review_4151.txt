In my house alone we have a bass player, a acoustic guitar player, a sax player and a violinist, that is not counting myself (I attempt to play mandolin and harmonica, usually I fail) so diverse instruments used to require different tuners but with this little all in one the clutter of tuners and pitchpipes is history, I just set aside a music nook in the family room with this mounted to a music stand and everyone can tune before practice, the sax player sneers at us tuners but still finds use for the reference notes and metronome function built into this little beauty.just be sure to buy theKorg CM-100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tunersif you want to tune your instrument while others are playing.
