I've had this for about 2 weeks now and this capo is simple and works great. It feels like plastic but is made of aluminum so it holds very well. If you know how much pressure to apply to the frets, the capo works great though I always have to do a bit of fine tuning, as was expected in the first place. I love how cheap it was compared to the other capos, and yes it's not made of plastic.
