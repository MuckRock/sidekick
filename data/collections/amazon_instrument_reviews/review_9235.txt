This is a very basic delay pedal, with the obvious knobs: delay volume, time and repeats. It has a nice bright sound, never too muddy and it's perfect for some Dave Gilmour style slap back delays.It only works with a power adapter, no battery. This has its pros and cons: on one side the pedal has a smaller foot print and costs less, on the other side if your power adapter breaks you're out of luck!Unlike many similar pedals this one doesn't let you set infinite repeats: this makes it impossible to make tricks a la Johnny Greenwood like creating quick loops and changing the delay speed to obtain weird noises. This is actually my favorite way of using delay pedals, so I returned it. Nonetheless, the product itself is great: cheap, sturdy and it does exactly what it's supposed to do.
