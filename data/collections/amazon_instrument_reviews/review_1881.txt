What do you expect for two dollars. I use this on a mic stand i got for my rockband mics. It took a little bit to shove the mic in and its just plastic, but seriously what do you want for two dollars. Its solid and it holds a mic, the seller had it to me in a few days  before amazon got me my mic stand  if your not a serious on stage rockin mother ...... you cant go wrong here.
