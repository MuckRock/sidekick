Rugged pedal by a little known company. Took a shot in the dark, hit a bullseye! Great univibeish/old chorus device. Would like to see stereo output options in future models. Solid. If you have a Strat, have studied Jimi, then it will suit you well if you've got the right physical approach to the guitar itself.
