Behringer usually makes good stuff and this Reverb Is No different but what It does best Is reverse reverb and moderate depth reverb Nothing else. I wanted this for Singing and I have the Danelectro FAB Echo which gives a short distance echo but I wanted something without the slap back and this does what I want It for but Not quite as much depth as I wanted but with The Music I do Not think Anyone can tell. If You want a good Reverb that Is above average with much depth then get the Behringer RV600 Not this. The power supply I use Is Danelectro which Is great, I also have a godlyke that I use.
