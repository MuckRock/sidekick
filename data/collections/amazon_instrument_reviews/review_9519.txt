I've tried so many other strings over the years just to see if I was missing something. I wasn't. There's something about the feel and tone of Ernie Ball Regular Slinkys that I absolutely love. My local music store has 3 for the price of 2 deal on strings, which is a nice deal; however, this deal is a little sweeter. If you can wait for the delivery, it's a no brainer.
