This product has turned out to be great with few exceptions.  It comes with three amplifier software packages and says you have the license to turn on any one of the three, not true.  The license included only works for one amp, the AC box combo and not the other two, you need to purchase the license for them.  Plus the instructions for getting the system installed and operational are poor.  You cannot run the output through your sound card to your PC speakers due to latency.  You must use the headphone jack on the interface.  In addition if you are in an austere environment and can't get to the internet to register your product immediately you are out of luck trying to make it work.  Once you overcome all of these obstacles it is a good little product.
