Item shipped earlier than I've expected. When I opened the box was surprised as I didn't notice the usb cable. But later I thought that it was impossible and opened the box from another side and here it was...I have plugged and installed usb driver and dedicated software in a few seconds. It is working fine. Though it has no motorized faders, it doesn't make my work uncomfortable at all. I have connected it to a Reaper and Protools software and it's just working perfect!I recommend it to home studios, also those who travel with recording gear. Nano is small but quite durable.I am happy with it!
