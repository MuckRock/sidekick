This simple rubber device works great on flat edged tables.  Table tops with a routed curved edge reduce how rubber is in contact with the table, which will effect how well it stays put.  Other then that I like it and purcheased a second one.  It is very inexpensive compared to guitar repairs.  There is also one available that looks like a guitar.
