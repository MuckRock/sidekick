The look of this strap caught my eye, I have a light colored natural look to my acoustic guitar and the blue complements it really well. The design is colorful and elaborate without being overly loud. Strong build, sort of a double layered nylon strap, and nice thick leather for the ends(one end was actually pretty difficult to put on the guitar when still new, but it should be easier with some wear). Easy to adjust, comfortable. I think that with many things you get what you pay for, and this strap is definitely worth the added cost over the cheap kinds you can get.
