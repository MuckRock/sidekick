The reason I bought this pedal was for the &#34;Space&#34; setting, which is essentially a shimmering organ, octave up effect. On the shortest time it is still slightly off with tracking, and it can get crowded with chords, but it does sound ethereal and choir-y.Features:Time controls the delay time between the dry and wet signals, decay controls the length of the reverberations, tone controls the color of the reverb, and mix controls the level of wet to dry (it can basically cut all the dry signal if desired).The trails feature can hold a reverb sound until it decays even with the switch off; however, if your mix is set to max wet signal, no sound will come through if enable and the pedal is off. I haven't really been able to use it effectively, so I just leave trails off.Dual ins and outs are useful for plugging in another instrument.Sounds:The classic reverb sounds (spring, plate, room, chamber) aren't very distinct from one another. The hall setting is bit more expansive; the ducking is nice for a continual shift from note to note, removing excess reverb for the latest notes/chords played. The cave and tile are a bit different timbre than the other reverb sounds; and the echo setting acts like a short regular digital delay.Cons:*The blue led is VERY bright, as on all Behringer pedals; I just cover it up with a sticker, and it still shows through.*the foot switch is digital, so it doesn't preserve state, and doesn't have the best assuring &#34;click&#34;*because it is buffered bypass, the effect will continue to draw power from a battery if a cable is plugged into it, even when off*the battery is difficult to get to because you have to press in on both sides of the switch, and then lift upAlso, almost 50% of the pedals weight is the bottom metal plate, which can be removed, but that makes the pedal almost toy-like in weight.
