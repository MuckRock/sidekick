I've only been in broadcasting for 3 years professionally and I have to say, after researching condenser microphones for several months, countless reviews and spec research I can honestly say, this mic compares and indeed exceeds many microphones costing hundreds of dollars more.Here's another interesting fact. I thought the &#34;King of all Media&#34;, Howard Stern would have used some gold plated 10 thousand dollar anniversary rig... well I found out he uses a 990 as well. So, think about it, perfect for the amateur, perfect for the professional... and under 100 dollars? Incredible! You WON'T be disappointed on this buy.
