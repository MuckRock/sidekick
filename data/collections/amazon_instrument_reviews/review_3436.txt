Lemon has been known for quite some generations to be a good cleaning solvent because of its acidic nature and this certainly does the job. As the label warns: do NOT to use on Maple-wood frets (mostly Fender strats) due to the softer & lighter quality. It is only for the harder, darker woods like mahogany (which I have) or ebony (high quality - i.e. expensive - used best for fretless). The solution is perfect, but the applicator (attached to the neck of the bottle) could be better. I would rather take the neck applicator out and apply lightly using a 100% cotton cloth.This solution has been made specifically for use on guitars, though I think you could find a similar lemon oil cleaner cheaper at local stores. It's only 4-oz, but what little is used each time, this bottle should last the guitar owner his/her life.
