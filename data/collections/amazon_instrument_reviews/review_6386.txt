This is a fairly compact &#34;must have&#34; accessory when working in pit or dim light situations. This music light will easily cover two pages of  music and at a stretch, three pages.The LEDs provide bright , white even coverage making it possible to see the pages of music. The heads are easily adjusted with the flexible mounting arms and the two stage light intensity switch is a good feature when a lesser intensity light is desired.The small size of the light makes it perfect for travelling.
