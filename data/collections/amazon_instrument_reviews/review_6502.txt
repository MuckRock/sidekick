My Hartke 410VX Cabinet was designed by an idiot....9 million pounds and no casters...not even holes for them. Who invented this thing, He-Man? Anyways, I bought these casters, got out the drill, and punched a few holes in the bottom of my amp, pounded these in, and now it ROLLS. Sadly one of the holes wasnt drilled quite straight making one caster a bit crooked so the amp veers to the right when I push it like a car missing a wheel. But its still better than carrying this beast everywhere my band is playing. Of course, we practice at the drummer's house and in his basement so I still have to carry it down and up his stairs, but that's life.
