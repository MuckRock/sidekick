I play guitar.  I bought one each of the various thicknesses of these picks a few years ago.  They're very interesting.  These are soft rubber with a little bit of give, so they really soften your attack and cut higher frequencies, similar to using your thumb, but not exactly.  I still pull one of these out every once in awhile.  In certain applications, getting a particular sound for a song, say, these could be exactly what you're looking for.  Overall these are well made, and the ones I bought will probably last me forever, but these would never work for me as a main pick.  I'm glad I tried them though, as I have nothing else remotely like them.
