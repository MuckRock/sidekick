I bought a case of these.  I can't handle #12 strings and the sound of #10 is terrible.  I prefer #12 strings for finger picking but they hurt my hands.  not the fingers but the hand and wrists, so .011 strings are what I use.  I am not sure if they get dirty and get corrosion but they are my main strings and I love the low price too!!
