Works just fine. Except the little knob that's supposed to take out the parts that hold in the strings (the little pins or whatever) it doesn't grip onto mine (I have an acoustic jasmine takkamine) so I had to get out pliers from my toolbox, but that's okay. One size doesn't always fit all. Good price.
