This amp is a quality item for the dollar range (I paid $49.99).  There is some question about sound quality and variation in quality.  We purchased two of these, and one arrived with some minor issues, constant humming regardless of volume or EQ settings.  Amazon did a wonderfully quick swap and the new one arrived without the problem.This is not a 6000W stage amp, nor is it so quiet enough to practice without disturbing the neighbors...it has a full punch output at full gain/volume, and can easily light up a back yard.Specs-Input: 1/4" Mono (not a tip and ring jack)Controls: Volume/Gain and selectable Volume 3-EQ range knobs.  There are two volume controls, once for each side of the push button selector.Outputs: 1/4" Mono (for monitor or mixer), 1/4" Dual Mono Headphone jack (tip and ring supplied from the same mono channel).Power:  Lighted front panel rocker switchThe box is very slim and small, about a foot by a foot and 8" deep, the rear is partially open, speaker exposed, and allows for cord storage.Pros--Portability, easy of use and set up.-Quality finish (leatherette with steel corners) and good construction, 6" heavy duty lead guitar speaker-Excellent sound and electronics for ANY amp under $100.  There are other manufacturers that have small wattage amps and smaller speakers that are $30-$50 more.  Go with this one.Cons--Units run hot and cold as to quality, but if it works out of the box, it's good, if not, you'll know it as soon as you power it up. Buy with confidence at Amazon from Amazon and you shouldn't have any worries.These amps power two Squier(tm) by Fender electric guitarsSquier by Fender Bullet Strat with Tremolo Bundle with Strings, Pick Card, and Polishing Cloth - Black, Rosewood Fretboardand do a great job.Other accessories for the beginner electric to consider:Cords -Hosa GTR210 Guitar Cable 10 Ft,Planet Waves Classic Series Instrument Cable, 10 feetStrap -Planet Waves Polypropylene Guitar Strap, BlackStraplocks -Dunlop Dual Design Straplok System, NickelHanger -String Swing Hardwood Home & Studio Guitar Hanger (Shades May Vary)
