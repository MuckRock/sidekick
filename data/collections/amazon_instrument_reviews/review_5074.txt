Excellent Quality and Craftsmanship.I was expecting less of this product for its price and the job it will do, I figured it would be made out of a "cheap" feeling metal. I was wrong. It is very stable and steady and feels like good steel or aluminum maybe. It is strong to. It feels like I could really bang it (I won't) and it would not break.I use this with an Audio Technica AT2020 which screws in perfectly snug but is still rotatable on the base. The mount holds it firm and keeps the mic still. It does eliminate a little vibration but if you pound on your desk (or whatever)that will still come through. It looks cool too (and everybody knows that matters). I am very pleased with this purchase.
