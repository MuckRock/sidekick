This product has almost zero documentation in the box or on the Akai Pro website.  Technical support is also almost zero.  Akai seems to not care about getting new users up to speed on their products.  Customer service is basically "If you have to ask, you should not buy this".  I asked the Akai technical department which sequencer software I needed and they told me to go to a Music store!  This may sound stupid but unless you have a lot of MIDI knowledge and experience don't buy this product.  Try finding a MIDI tutorial that is usable.  Good luck with that chore.Added 08Nov2010: The keyboard arrived with one of the bottom rubber footpads missing.  I sent an email to Akai asking for a replacement but they do not have any parts.  I find that unbelievable.
