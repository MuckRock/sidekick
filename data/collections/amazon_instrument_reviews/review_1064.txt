Sounds simply great!  As greasy as a Pignose has to groan and as simple as it has to be.  Great on bass notes and can also get clean with highs; it does sound different when opened and by moving the guitar volume, it changes its distortion (the louder, the more distorted).  The Pignose power supply (Pignose AC9 Power Supply for Pignose 7100) is helpful when been home, but also works with 6 AA batteries.  You can also amplify it's sound by connecting it to a higher-watt amp.  It comes with really nice looking stickers.  I'm planning to keep it for years.Update on review(Jan 9, 2013).I admit that it might be more expensive that other 5 watt amps, but as time goes by, I just fall more in love with my Piggy!  I've learned to use better it's own volume combined with the guitar's.I have other amps of higher power that can get a LOT louder that the Pignose, but I just LOVE the level of distortion it gives; I cannot get this crunch with the other amps, no matter how much pedals, bells, whistles I have tried... This crunch is unique and the world loves it, as simple and plain as that.  The good thing is that it has an output at the back to connect it to louder amps and like that you can have at louder volumes that unique crunch I so much fell in love with.The 7 chords give a clean amazing sweet-grumble (the one that make teenage girls sigh for you...) with high volume on the Piggy and low on the guitar.
