I replaced a bone non-compensated saddle of my parlor sized guitar with this.This is a convenient product as the thing is already close to final thickness you need, you don't need to change the compensation much if at all,  the material sands easier than bone, polishes well, and the tone is really good.A little careful sanding/polishing and the guitar was ready to play. I like the product.
