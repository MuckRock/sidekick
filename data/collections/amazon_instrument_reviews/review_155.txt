This thing is like a magic Spray! Hah!Seriously... I used this on noisy hinges, car doors, etc.I really bought it to clean the POTs (volume controls and knobs) on my Guitars, pedals and equipment. It really does work and gets rid of the static noise you get when you turn your volume control on your radio or guitar for example.
