I haven't used it a lot yet, but I really like it so far.. Much easier to put on than the 30 year old capo I was using, and it works for my guitars and my banjo, without putting them out of tune. It seems to be solidly made as well, and not too much pressure as others said.. My old capo put a lot more pressure than this does :P, and was much heavier. I'd assume it was made out of Cast-Iron or something instead of Aluminum.
