This is great idea to clean guitar strings. I've always wiped down the necks of my guitars but this allows you to clean the underside of the strings as well as the top.Simple to use, small to fit inside a case or gig bag and not expensive.Using this will help lengthen the life of your strings and pay for itself in no time.
