I've owned this pedal for about 8 years.  It's good overall, but the reverbs fall short of ideal for me.  They just sound a bit inauthentic, and this is noticeable at times, but in a band setting probably wouldn't be noticable.  I think it's the way they trail off.  The tails tend to have a little unnatural decay, or something.I've been using the Boss Fender reverb pedal for about 3 years now as my main reverb (neither of my amps have reverb) and what I've done in the last year is that I use this Digitech with a wetter setting (usually church or hall) if I want reverb on a solo.  For that application it works fine and sounds great.  As a "leave it on all the time" reverb I find it a bit lacking.But if you want a bunch of decent sounds you could do much worse.  Plus this thing is obviously rugged, I've abused it (not really, just regular gigging abuse) for all this time and it's never failed to work.  But that's been my overall experience with Digitech stuff for a long time.
