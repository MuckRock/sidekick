For under $200, I'm amazed at how nice this guitar is!  First, it was perfectly playable right out of the box - all I had to do was tune it.  And it stays in tune nicely too.I did replace the strings shortly after getting it.  There was nothing wrong with the original strings - no rust and they sounded fine - I just wanted something softer so I put on Dedario Silk and Steel light strings, which are much easier on my fingers and have a nice mellow sound.  I am a novice transitioning from a nylon string guitar so I needed the most gentle strings I could get.  Now this guitar is a joy to play.  Problem is, I get nothing done because I can't put it down!!!And the spruce top is pure eye candy as are the mahogany back and sides. And I like the mother of pearl Yahama inlay on the headstock. Very classy! The quality of build and finish on this instrument is top notch.  It just exudes quality and feels solid and balanced in your hands.You can spend a lot more on a guitar, but why would you want to when you can get something like this???
