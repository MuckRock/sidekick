I bought a classical guitar and then realized that I needed on of the around the neck with a sound hole hook type straps.  Bought one and due to past neck surgery, found that strap painful to wear after a few minutes.  Later saw this one and decided to try it.  Works perfect, really adjustable, and no pressure on my neck (since it doesn't go around your neck).  Great design!
