As accurate and easy to use as the excellent Korg DT-10, I plugged in the battery, hooked up my guitar( which I had just tuned using a Korg DT-10 that I already own) and it came up in meter mode and verified exactly the tuning that the DT-10 gave me! I love it! Nice footprint, very easy to see the indicators in a bright room or on a darkened stage, one input 1/4&#34; jack on the right, one output 1/4&#34; jack on the left. Simple to use. I probably will never use the other three display modes, but it's nice tht they are there if I want to play with them. The perfect tuner.
