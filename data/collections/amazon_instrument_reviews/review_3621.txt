This was exactly what I needed for the price range I could afford in a crunch.  My old mic just wasn't cutting it going into my computers USB audio interface.There are nice changes in sound texture from different angles.  It is really sensitive to pop and breath so a pop filter is critical for vocals.  It is recording my guitar beautifully.I've even been able to record nice quick tracks for copyright recordings of both my voice and guitar.  I've set the stand low and angled the mic towards the guitars sound hole (slightly back) and sing into the top at about 45 degrees and back a little.  I found a quick comfortable balance and the result is warm and clean.I'm very happy with this unit (price considered but I'd have to pay a LOT more to improved on it).  I'll probably get another one.  I kind of wish I'd have bought that combo kit.
