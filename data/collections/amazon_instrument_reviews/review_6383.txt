This light clips on the back of the stand and hold nicely.  The light from the LEDs has a blue tint to it. I'd prefer something more 'white'. Each light can be controlled individually and has a low and high setting. I gave 4 starts because it doesn't get quite as bright as I'd like but it does the job.  It seems well-made and will operate off battery power as well as an AC adapter which is included.
