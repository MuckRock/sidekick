I bought this to complement a 414ce-LTD (Fall 2011) guitar, and wanted to have something that would last a long time, and provide a nice suede feel to keep the strap from sliding around on my shoulder.It took a little bit to get the hole over the butt peg of the guitar - it almost seemed the slit they cut was too small. After working at it a few minutes, I got it to fit, and it wore really nicely once I got the length where I wanted. Taking it on/off the guitar isn't too much trouble, but over the past few months the bottom slit has stretched a little more - enough to make it easier to get it on. I'm glad that it came a little tighter initially - the leather stretches over time, and it's clear they had that in mind when they make these. The quality is excellent, and I'm buying another one to go with my 12-string Taylor.
