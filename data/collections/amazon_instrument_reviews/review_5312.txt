A good quality cable to use while playing sitting, to go down to my processor on the floor in front of me. The angle goes up tight to the floor unit and out of the way and 5 feet is plenty. Great cable! I use Fender's 15 foot angle plug from the processor to my amp because stepping on the plugs can break the jacks.
