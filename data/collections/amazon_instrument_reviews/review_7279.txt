I've had this amp about a week now and I'm still finding cool things about it. The first thing I did was went through all the presets. I didn't like the clean channel,( it wasn't really clean) but I quickly found out how to set it like i wanted it (press the clean button then turn all the preset effects to 0 and then hold down on the clean button about three seconds until the lights blink and now it's really clean. You can also do this with all the other channels too! just set every thing like you want it and hold down the button on the channel you want and there it is. and don't worry, you can always reset it back to factory settings and start over. It's a small amp but it's bigger than I thought it would be. But the sound that comes out of that 8&#34; speaker is BIG!. I have been playing for about 30 years, and I know I could use this amp in a small club without running it into the PA. If you do need a little more volume, it has a line out so you can run it to the PA and have all the volume you want. I would buy this amp again if mine was stolen. Makes a great practice room amp. You can take it without all your pedals and still have all the effects you would need. For the price it's a bargain!
