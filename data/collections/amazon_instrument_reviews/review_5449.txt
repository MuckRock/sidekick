This is a terrific product.  While the price might seem a little high for a power adapter, it actually serves the function of what you might need several other adapters and daisy chains to accomplish.The key to the OneSpot is the 1700mA output.  By comparison, the Boss PSA-120 adapter puts out 200mA.  Since most stompboxes draw between 5 and 60 mA of power, you could only reliably chain up to about 3 or 4 of them with the BOSS adapter.The combo kit is a great value because it comes with a daisy chain for up to eight pedals, and some other parts for hookups to a 9V adapter or other jacks that I don't use on my pedals.  I use it with BOSS and Ibanez pedals and it works great.  Best of all, there's no added electric "buzzing" noise, which is a problem with many budget power solutions.Also like how the cable hookups are angled instead of straight - makes much more sense for a tight pedalboard.  No more 9V's and no more hooking up multiple cables every time - one simple plug and I'm ready to play!
