HOLD feature allows you to "record" individual "tracks" and overlap them on one another on the go--live!  Dont get too ambitious though as the more "tracks" you add the more distorted the sound becomes.  I haven't used expensive rack units etc., but this is great fun and versatility allows many different uses.  Excellent value.  Battery runs out fast so get an AC adaptor!
