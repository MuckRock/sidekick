Who would have thought you could buy "quality" bass guitar strings from the same place you can buy your DVDs?The strings are, with out a doubt, real Fender strings. And even with shipping coasts they are STILL comparably-priced if not cheaper then buying them at a nationaly franchised music store.But...Because you don't have the opportunity to compare strings; I do recommend that you know what you want.I've also purchased "top shelf" guitar stings, as well as a variety of other products, from AMAZON and have ALWAYS been satisfied with the qualiy and service.
