These strings I put on my Taylor GA4E.  They had a very nice and balanced mids and highs.  These strings fit very nicely for a acoustic guitarist that is playing with a bassist and supporting instruments.  These strings fill and fit the acoustic spectrum nicely.  Nice mids and ringing highs.  Not a lot of bass.  But very nice balance as I said.  YMMV.
