This is the Godzilla of volume pedals. It is a beautiful, massive, piece of metallic magic that appears to have no loss of tone as I run signal through it. It appears to be indestructible. I like that it has a &#34;tuner output&#34; and that the stiffness of the pedal action can be adjusted with a large slotted screwdriver. When a friend offered to sell his for $30 bucks I bought it without hesitation. I now have one in the front of my system and the second is placed farther down right after my Ditto looper so I can fade it out. Volume swells can be done from either pedal with slightly different results. If you need &#34;light&#34;, maybe keep looking. If you don't mind the heft, you will be pleased.
