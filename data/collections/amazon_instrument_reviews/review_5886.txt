I like to walk around while I play. It's a hangup of mine. This strap works fine for that. The only thing I've noticed that can be annoying is that strap moves easily across my back so it is very easy to get the guitar out of position (the neck too high or too low). Other than that, it's a good deal for the price. Maybe I just need a shirt with more cling.
