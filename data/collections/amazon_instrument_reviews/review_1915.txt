I like the sound and sensitivity these heads produce for the snare side of my snare drum. A work of caution though, like all snare resonant heads, these are very thin! They must be to produce the sensitivity in the snare wires required. But you must be careful. I tore a small hole in one of mine with the snare wires because the end of the snare wires were too close to the bearing edge. Not Remo's fault but it is something to pay attention to.
