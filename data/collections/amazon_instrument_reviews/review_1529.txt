I've been using elixers on my Godin Multiac Steel SA for many years now. They have a great, not-too-bright sound and you don't get the string noise when you move your hands across the neck like you do with traditional strings. These tend to last me about 3 months! So, I am very happy with them. They also track pretty well with my roland synth, so no gripes there. All in all I really like these strings and think they sound great.
