I'm a new guitarist and nobody else would want to hear everything I play. I however, am having a ball playing as loud as I want with as much or as little gain as I feel like at the moment with my Classic Rock Guitar Headphone Amp. My Rickenbacker 360 sounds just the way I want, with as much clarity or with all the &#34;smoke&#34; as I feel like dialing in for now. It is SO nice to be free of the amp and cable on the floor and can quickly plug in, put in my ear buds, and practice for a while anywhere I want, anytime I want. Downside: I wish it had a little reverb to dial in or switch on to closer match my full size Vox amp and the controls are small/hard to read but easy to learn. You do get a pop when you turn it on because there is no tube warm up time. Solution: Hit the switch before putting in your buds if your sensitive. I plan to pick up other versions of the amPlug from Vox to extend my fun. This was a good choice. Buy one!
