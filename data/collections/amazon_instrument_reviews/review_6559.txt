I already had one of these for the studio from another vendor and picked this one up as well. It was really old and dusty like its been laying around for years but that aside it works perfectly to put my camera right where I need it. Holds Zoom recorder as well with no issues when I am recording. This works perfectly to transform any mic stand into a more than worthy tripod.
