This little thing is just what I needed for my acoustics. My amp has a tuner but my regular acoustics had no true way of being tuned until now. I have one on each acoustic and they tune them right up. The read-out is easy to see since it gives you color guides to tune by. Red is wayyy off, yellow when you start getting close and green when you are in tune. Great for a quick look in between songs. Highly recommended.
