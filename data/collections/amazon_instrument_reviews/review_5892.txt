Excellent strap for the money. The leather is thick and supple. In fact the materials are so thick, that it can be a little tricky to get the adjustment tail setup.A note about length- Some might find the standard Levy's strap length too short, so be aware what you need and note there are XL versions of these. For me, many straps on the market in this price range are just too long for me, including those from Franklin, Dunlop (BMF wide), and Mono (even the short model was about an inch too long). I'm a bass player and when standing, I prefer my bass to be at or just above waist height. A few basses, I prefer higher. I'd suggest if you have a strap which places your instrument where you are most comfortable, measure button hole to button hole and be sure you're ordering the right length.
