I have played on D'addario Before,  actually the first string I started out on.Super light's are ok,  but can wear out real fast,  So, It's importent not to put to much stess on  them.....espescially if You do alot of tricks, pinched hormonic's vibrato's, extreme bend's,  etc  they will break.  Any skilled guitarist know's  to use  extream  caution when tuning....any strings,I did try extra light (while they do soud nice,and have a nice feel to them)  I would not recamend these for beginer's,  cause beginer's tend to press hard, when they first stat out.Personally,  I don't like D'addario's at all,  I find the tone to bright.
