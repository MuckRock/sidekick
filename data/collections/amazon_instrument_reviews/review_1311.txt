the winder works really well and same with the cutter, but using the cutter can be a bit cumbersome.  i guess for taking w/ you on gig bag would be great as you only have one tool, but if using at home, then i think is more convenient to have a separate cutter.  that's what i do anyway.  still i think is a good tool to have.
