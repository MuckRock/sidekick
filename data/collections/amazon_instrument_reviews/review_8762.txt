I wasn't sure about spending a lot of money on a guitar since I was just starting out.  I bought this to work with Rocksmith 2014 and it did the job just fine.  The guitar needed some work to get it properly set up since tuning it straight out of the box sounded horrible.  It turns out that the intonation needed to be set properly and also the strings that it came with are garbage.I put new strings on it and fixed the intonation, adjusted the truss rod a bit and adjusted the string height (all with just the tools that they provided with the guitar) and it sounded a lot better. Unfortunately there's no 22nd fret on this guitar.  That probably shouldn't come as a big surprise as a lot of stratocaster type guitars only have 21 frets, but there's this one song that requires me to bend the high e string on the 22nd fret...The single coil pickups have quite a bit of hum on them so for rocksmith you kinda have to calibrate it a few times to make sure that it doesn't pick up much of that hum, or else you resort to using the 2nd and 4th switch setting so that it uses two pickups at once which cancels out the hum.I think if you wanted to try modding your guitar this would probably be a decent choice too.  I haven't gotten that far yet.  I've had it since February, changed strings on it twice (in 4 months) and so far it's proven to be a fairly nice little guitar to learn on...except for that 22nd fret (oh well).
