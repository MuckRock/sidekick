I teach guitar classes at a community college and spend my days in a room full of twangin' 'n strummin' guitars. Human ears and tuners with external mics, including iPhone app tuners, have trouble in such an environment. Why? The cacophony of competing pitches befuddle both brains and tuning machines.  So I bring an extra beefySeiko Sat800 Durable Style Chromatic Tunerand Korg CM-100L mic to class for students to use. And it works great: clip to the headstock and it isolates their guitar from the din and delivers a clean signal to the Seiko.The Seiko tuner has hit the deck many times and still looks like new after a couple years. Unfortunately the CM-100L is not nearly as durable: wires are thin, delicate and prone to breaking. If I was the only one using the CM-100L, it would probably last for many years. But students are rough and can't stop themselves from tightly wrapping the wire around the tuner after they're finished (although I ask them not to). The wire gets stressed at the mic clip and/or plug and shorts out. I burn through one or two CM-100L per semester. I found a big gob of silicon sealant on stress points helps extend the life of the wire (electrical tape is useless).Great product: easy to use and makes tuning in a room full of guitars a snap. Wish they made an industrial strength model with big beefy cables...
