There are many cheapie string winders out there, they all look pretty much the same....but they most certainly are not. This one built like a tank. with thick, solid construction. It's built for the long haul. It fits every tuning peg it's ever been fit to, has a cool little compartment built in thats perfect for extra acoustic bridge pins and extra pics, and simply is tough as nails. This is the last one you will ever need to buy.
