The main advantage of this recorder to me is that I can get a good result without knowing much.I've made some surprisingly good recordings of choir concerts in various venues without any special knowledge, though I'm sure knowing more would make my recording sound better.About the only thing you should absolutely learn is to set the mic gain correctly so you don't overpower the mic. I don't use auto gain.If anything I try to err on the side of low. Excellent low noise property of the unit means that, except some rare cases, I can just boost the sound later on PC and the result is still more than passable for my purpose.
