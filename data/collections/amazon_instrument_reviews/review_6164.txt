While I've never been a big delay guy, I've always felt my pedal board was missing this particular effect.  I'm definitely not a fan of digital delay, so I did a lot of R&D; on analog delays in hopes to find the right one for me.There are basically three options out there for delays under $200: MXR Carbon Copy, EHX Memory Boy, and Malekko Ekko 616.  I realize that there are other pedals out there, but according to my research these are the best three for the price.The Memory Boy seemed good but my concern was it can do a lot of exaggerated modulation, something I was not interesting in.  Crazy effects are an EHX trademark so if you're looking for that sort of thing the Memory Boy might be up your alley.  I read nothing but good things about the Malekko Ekko and tossed back and forth between that and the Carbon Copy for a while and ultimately went with the Carbon Copy because I was able to find the most first-hand reviews of it.I don't regret my decision, this pedal sounds great.  The repeats are long and do not sound artificial.  Some people complain the repeats are too dark but I don't think those people understand the difference between analog and digital delay.  If you're looking to recreate The Edge sound, analog delay is not for you.I'm able to create all types of sounds from this pedal from just thickening up a rhythm track, to slapstick, to dreamy repeats on solos.  I love it.  Sometimes I just leave the pedal on with the mix knob dialed down for subtle ambience in my tone.One minor criticism is that the modulation effect is subtile, at least out-of-the-box.  There are internal trimpots to make the effect more pronounced but I have yet to mess with them.  I would rather have had the controls be knobs on the pedal itself.
