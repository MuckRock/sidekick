The Fulltone Full Drive 2 is another incarnation of the original Fulldrive. Now with MOSFET circuitry available via toggle switch, this just makes the pedal even more flexible. Not to mention boutique quality at a working man's price.This device is built solid and sports a powder blue coat finish. The volume knob gives you lots of gain, the tone knob is a "presence" control, the overdrive knob adjusts the level of overdrive, and then there is the boost level. Yes, this is a 2-switch pedal, so when you are playing a chunky rhythm you can step on the "boost: switch for a great lead tone.The toggle switch in between the tone and drive knobs affect the pedals tonal character as well as how the knobs affect each other. There is "comp cut" allowing for a cleaner boost, FM for "flat mids," and "vintage" for a more Tubescreamer tone.As a bonus, the pedal is also capable of running on 18v power for cleaner headroom, which is handy for hum bucker pick-ups.If you have the scratch and are, looking for a perfect OD pedal then look at the Fulldrive 2. It may wind up having a permanent position on your pedal board.
