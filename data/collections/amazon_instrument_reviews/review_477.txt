The problem with this pedal is that you have to step all the way down on it to turn it on, which produces a sound.  The Morley pedals have a separate on/off switch, so you can turn them on or off at a given position.  The difference is the sound is just a bit more professional if the wah isn't always turning on or off at the top of the wah frequency.  Suppose you wanted to set the wah in the middle, and just leave it there.  You can't really do that with this pedal.  It is a bit smaller than a morley wah, but in my experience, the sound is equivalent on the base models.
