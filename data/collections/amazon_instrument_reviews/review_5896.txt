This thing is really comfortable, holds the weight of my les paul nicely. Its slightly wider than most other straps which helps distribute weight better, I can play for 2+ hours and my shoulders feel fine! I feed the narrow end through 3 of the strap holes and it sits flat and looks good. Well made, feels very strong.  Texture is very nice, doesnt slip.  Overall a very good product.
