While I have heard that these devices can be great for recording concerts and have heard some great recordings to back that claim up my review will be focusing on my main use which is podcasting.  After using the Zoom H4N for a few weeks I've found it to be a very versatile tool that should be in any podcaster's arsenal of gear.I mainly use the H4N to record my podcasts using a Allen & Heath ZED14 mixing board.  I usually do a two person podcast where I am in one location and the other person is brought in via Skype.  Using the Aux sends of the board and the 4 track mode of the H4N I can record myself in one channel, the other person in another channel and all of the sound effects and music supplied by my iPad into its own stereo channel.  This makes editing a breeze as everything is on its own track.The sound quality of the H4N is excellent and it is very easy to hook up external microphones to the unit.  You can hook up either two XLR microphones or two 1/4&#34; jack sources (or a combination) to the bottom of the unit and there is one 1/8&#34; input on the back of the unit that will accept a stereo microphone or any line level stereo source.  It's the combination of these that lets me record the podcast onto the 4 separate tracks.The H4N will also let you record using two attached microphones and the internal microphones at the same time as well, which could be useful if you're looking to capture some background noise if you are recording something on location or say to mix the crowd reaction to a soundboard feed.Overall this is a great device for podcasters both in the studio and out in the field, letting you produce high quality recordings in both environments.  Five stars without a doubt.
