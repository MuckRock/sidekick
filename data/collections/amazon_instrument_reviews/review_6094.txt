I was still searching for a pick to replace the ones I left somewhere. I knew these were not the ones I sought, but they are great. They don't move around in my hand, I have yet to drop one, and for the first time I noticed that a pick can make a difference in the sound of a guitar. These sound great. I've found a new favorite pick.
