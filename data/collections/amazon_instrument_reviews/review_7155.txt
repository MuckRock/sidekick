A cute little monster that's surprisingly loud and versatile. I bought primarily for travel and I'm pleased with my purchase. Don't expect too much for $20 (it's all plastic) and you should be satisfied too. The amp comes with helpful instructions showing different tone settings (fuzz, twang, etc.). I also purchased the AC adaptor since these things typically eat batteries.
