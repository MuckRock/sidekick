This unit works great for taking a line level from something like an audio mixer or even an old cassette deck and converting it into a USB audio input. I have not used the headphone monitoring section (doubt I ever would) so I cannot comment on that feature, but this unit is so simple to use that I was pleasantly surprised.For anyone in a band out there - I used this device to take a line out from our PA system into an old laptop running (free) Audacity software and was blown away by the quality of the recording. This even helped us to figure out better vocal balance technique for some parts that were not quite perfect on stage.
