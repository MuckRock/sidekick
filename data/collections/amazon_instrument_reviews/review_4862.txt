I put two pickups in my resonator guitar, a magnetic and a transducer.  This is the IMD--improvised musical device--solution to using both pickups without building a little box with two volume controls.  I plug two cords into the mixer, one from each pickup, and blend and balance the two pickups.  It works.  It cost a a little more than buying the parts to build something like an electric guitar wiring setup but it works out of the box so the labor cost is almost zero.  Bonus, it's an active device so it can boost the signal.  Only con is that it runs on 12 V and doesn't have a battery option.  I can live with that.
