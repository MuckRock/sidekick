I love these picks, they are my favorite! I bought a pack of 72 after trying the pack of 12 last year. These picks are sturdy and wont break that easily. I use them for rhythm runs and even lead. They are perfect for rhythm, flexible. My only wish is if they had some grip (raised end where you hold). For lead these sound dull. I much prefer a brighter, more chimey sound.Overall great product!
