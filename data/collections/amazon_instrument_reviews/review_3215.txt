i got mine yesterday and love it, it sounds grate ,i didn't know what amp to get, i looked and looked ,read a lot of reviews and even got on YouTube to see what people had to say, and seems this one had a lot of good reviews,, i knew fender has a good name for amps , and for the money this one was the one, i am so glad i got it , it gave life to my electric guitar, i bought mine somewhere else ,but still grate amp ,,i didn't want to spend a lot of money for an amp ,and didn't want to get something small  for 20 or 30 dollars less and would out grow with my music,as i get better playing guitar, but figure this amp will do me just fine for many years to come and it will. this will save me money in the long-run ,i am very happy with it,i like the five year warranty that came with it, you can't go wrong ,great sound,, and its not to big ,,nice size amp,,and  easy to pick-up,,nice looking amp ,,
