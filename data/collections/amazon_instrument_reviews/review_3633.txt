Dont use the cheap fog liquid as it smells bad and gums up the system if you leave it in too long.I got this last year for a small party and had the smoke alarm going off in my basement within seconds.  This beast puts out lots of fog and does a nice job.It does get hot and drips at the front if you spray for too long but it does do what it's supposed to.  Also note that the cap on the machine doesn't seal well and will drip if you angle the unit too much.Keep it away from walls and floors as the oil will collect on them and leave you with a mess to clean up later.  It's best on a stand 3-4 feet off the ground.Overall build quality is very nice.  Metal case, compact, nice bracket, lighted remote telling you when it's ready.The threads on the tank are plastic as is the cap and can be damaged if you cross thread which is quite easy...
