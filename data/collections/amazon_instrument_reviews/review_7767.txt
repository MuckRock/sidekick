First off the pedal is constructed of metal and feels really durable. Turning the knobs on the pedal reveals the the smooth and efficient quality of the pods. The pedal &#34;gets along&#34; fine with no interference with the other pedals on my board. The sound is exceptional and can be adjusted  within a wide range to one's liking. I can't say it's my favorite pedal, but it sure does play a nice role on my pedal board of various effects.
