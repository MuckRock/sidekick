These Dava picks are very nice. They are about the equivalent of a medium weight pick.The rubber grip area is great. The feel is soft, just perfect for holding a long time. The Dunlop picks with the bumps are nice, but this just feels a lot better between my fingers.There are three little lines at the center of the pick, the bottom line is supposed to be less flex and the top line is supposed to have more flex. This is really hard to position my fingers on exactly the spots and there isn't much of an effect no matter where I place my fingers. The effect is subtle at best.The only criticism is the tip is a little bit too short; the rubber can end up striking the string.Overall, I like these picks a lot. The colors are cool and the rubber feels really good in my hand.
