I was very pleased when I got my Beatles Tin and Collector Picks. The service was good and prompt and the price was very reasonable. I was surprised at how cool both the Tin and the Picks were, they are a real talking point and a must have for Muso's who like individual items in their collection. Thanks again Cheers !!!
