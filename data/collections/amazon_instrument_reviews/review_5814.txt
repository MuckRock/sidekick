I read the reviews on this product and decided that a lot of these reviewers probably know more about guitar effects than I do and since most people seemed to like it, I figured I'd give it a try.  I was not disappointed at all.  It gives you great sound for solos.  I've tried it on a few different kinds genres and found that it's quite versatile.  I still have to play with the settings a bit to really get the sound I want, but I think that's just learning about the effects this box provides.
