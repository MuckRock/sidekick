This tuner works great. I put in a 9 volt battery a couple of months ago and it still is going strong. It will take a 9 volt output from my power supply and I can then piggyback to another pedal, which is great. It is very, very accurate and does not get confused under normal conditions. You do need to hit only one string at a time, however. Size is perfect for a pedalboard small but still quite readable. Price is very good. I had a Boss in the past but took it back because it just seemed so overpriced and too complicated.
