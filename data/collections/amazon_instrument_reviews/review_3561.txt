I purchased this to interface the XLR plug on a Sennheiser E825-S mike with the input on guitar amplifiers. it seemed to work very well in this role. It was well-constructed, with all the connecting points working precisely and securely.Somewhat after the fact, I started worrying about whether I should have instead gotten an adapter with impedance matching capabilities. I'm hardly a professional technician in this area, but I did do enough research to figure out a good working answer: Lo-Z (low impedance) microphones (say, 1,000 ohms or less) generally do not have to be matched to solid-state amplifiers, which are likely to have Hi-Z (high impedance) inputs in the range of 10,000 ohms. These amplifiers ae generally designed to accommodate a 10:1 impedance ratio (load to source). I calculated the signal loss of such an arrangement in the range of 0.83 decibels, which is incidental.This corresponds to what my ears tell me: this adapter works just fine without impedance matching. I can't say for sure whether that also holds for tube amps but will update my review if I have a chance to find out.UPDATE: since I wrote my initial review, I have discovered that Pyle seems to have a problem securing its connectors properly with set screws. If you purchase this item, I suggest you have a micro-screwdriver set handy so you can tighten everything up before you discover to your chagrin that a loose set screw has gone missing or caused your connector to fall apart.
