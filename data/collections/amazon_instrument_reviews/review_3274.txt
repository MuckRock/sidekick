Used the 9-42's for years but thought I would give these a try. Fuller sound with the 10-46's butI cannot bend them like the 9's. I have switched back on a few of then guitars for variety: 10's for rhythm and finger style, 9's for lead. Get the packs of single 9's and 10's too so that when one breaks you dont have to steal from another whole set.
