In the interest of full disclosure, this is the first guitar strap I have ever owned. That being said, the strap is fairly soft and pliable, with that almost broken in feel. I was expecting it to be a little stiffer, but I'm glad it isn't. It fit my Ibanez acoustic just fine. My guitar is nothing fancy, so I would presume the "strap locks" are pretty standard. The fit is really tight at first, so that should be a good thing. I suppose I could have unscrewed my strap locks to facilitate mounting the strap, but I didn't.The range of fit seems pretty good to me. I am 6' tall and wear my acoustic up a little high, kind of "folk style" I guess. If I want to, I can adjust it so that it rides lower around my pelvis area. One end is suede on both sides and has the tanned leather-logo patch on it, while the other end is black suede on one side and tan suede on the backside. I can't see it marring the guitar at all. It is comfortable around my neck and shoulder. Made in Canada, seems well built and durable. Once again my left shoe is happy to have its lace back, and Keith gets to keep his head fashionable. If you have any questions, feel free to ask and I will answer as best I can. Thanks for reading.SPO
