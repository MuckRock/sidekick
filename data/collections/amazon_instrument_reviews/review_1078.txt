I have quite a few mic stands, and picked this up to use for micing a guitar cabinet. I love the low profile and the design of the feet - it's very sturdy, and all around better than the DR stands that I have which cost twice as much. It has plenty of weight to it and enough reach to easily reach all 4 speakers in my 4x12 without becoming &#34;tippy&#34;.5/5, though it would have been nice if it shipped with more than just the single cable clip.
