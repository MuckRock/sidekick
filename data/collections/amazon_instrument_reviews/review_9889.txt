If you are ordering these to replace one or two of your Gibson Speed knobs, you will want to replace all four because they are not identical to Gibson's.In all fairness, these could possibly be BETTER than Gibson's stock, seem to be made with a more solid underside, but the numbers are a little bit smaller.This is the only reason I gave them four stars.Fit perfectly on CTS potentiometers and if you replace all four of them, nobody except you will know! -lol.All four of mine were fine with no apparent flaws or defects, as opposed to other reviews.If you get these and they aren't perfect...send them back until you get a perfect set! It's free!Hope this helps...not much else to say!
