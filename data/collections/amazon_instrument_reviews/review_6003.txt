i bought this cable in an emergency situation - one where I was on the road, needed a great cable, and didn't have access to roll my own using, what would've been, essentially the same parts.  I exclusively use canare and mogami in the studio, and in critical places of my live setup.  The cable itself is top shelf, quiet, and will provide years of use if you treat it even with modest respect.  As an instrument cable, this could possibly  be a little short if you move around a bunch, making it worth it to go for the 18' cable as a bass or guitar player if you don't like being tied down.  I used this as part of a keyboard rig, where it was perfect on all levels - quality reproduction of sound across the entire spectrum (the highs were crystal, the bass clear), connection is solid (I am not a gold fanatic, but these are excellent), great warranty, and a reputation that holds value.  (These are real deal pro cables, as opposed to some cables priced similarly that have a monster price, but not necessarily a superior build or sound, which is why I didn't walk into guitar center and buy a pair of monster 1000's and waited for these to be delivered overnight instead,,,)
