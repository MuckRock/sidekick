i got this to hold set lists and lyrics on stage and at rehearsal.  the clipboard is small and wont hold more than a few sheets but is great for holding a set list and one or two sheets of lyrics or chord charts.  i hang it down from the boom and it is inconspicuous and suits my needs just fine so far.
