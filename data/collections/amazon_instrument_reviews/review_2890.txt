I had been using 12's on my S35 Takamine and they were over powering the chassis with vibration. The result was poor sound. Switching to these 10's made a huge difference in tone. It took a bit to get used to the lightness but now I will stick with them on this guitar. They are also easy to do bends which I like alot. I have never broke a D'Addario acoustic string.
