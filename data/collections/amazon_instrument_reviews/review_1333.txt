After you have used this tool for the first time, you say to yourself,...&#34;why did I suffer all those years by doing this manually?&#34; I used to devote so much time to sitting there, winding forever by hand. With this winder, you are done in an amazingly short time. It also does such a precise job on installing the string around the posts, that on the bottom &#34;E&#34;, I did a double take -- it is almost invisible. Thank you to the other guitarists who took the time to do their reviews on this one. Re-stringing is now no longer the chore that I used to dread. Not at all.
