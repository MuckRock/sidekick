After taking my guitar lessons...I never knew there were soooo many kinds of flexibility or thickness of picks for guitars. My instructor told me that I need a variety to see which one or two felt good in my strumming hand, and to see if I could pick out some melody's without too much problem. I realize the pick is not magical that it plays with out me doing the work, and I have been having fun trying all sorts of sizes, flexibilities, and strengths. Just go for the gusto and find what you like!
