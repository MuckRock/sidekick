First things first. If you have one or many expensive guitars BUY THESE. They keep you guitar safe from falling. To take it off all you do is hold down a button in the side and your strap and the lock with pop off. It's very handy. Very very easy to install and protects. Be warned they are bigger than they look but to do what they do so well they must be big.
