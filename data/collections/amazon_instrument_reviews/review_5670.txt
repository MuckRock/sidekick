I found the price on Amazon cheaper than my local guitar shop and quickly bought it. The slide works smoother than a brass slide on an acoustic/electric guitar and also sounds great with a Cigar Box Guitar with piezo pickup. The slide is thick and the large size fits well on the middle, ring and pinky finger.I found the tone of both guitars brighter and more defined using this slide compared to a brass slide which suits an electric guitar better IMO. I have not tried a ceramic slide with any guitar, but a Dunlop ceramic slide is most likely a future purchase.Jim Dunlop products are solid and last long for the most part, their slides seem to be the most popular brand aside for boutique bottle slides and I think this one will last a long time.
