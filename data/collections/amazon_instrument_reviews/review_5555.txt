ok when i saw the bag i was impressed nice looking and perfect style so i decided to buy it but the bag just arrive home "12/23/11" and is way different from the one on the picture is a black bag with one ugly red line on the middle and it looks like is not going to protect my guitar i am really upset, i would not returned because i don't feel like fighting with no body but they shouldn't do that to the costumer we pay how much they asking so a least we should get what we pay for.
