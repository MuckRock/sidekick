I have always hated tuners; I would rather use tuning fork on the A string and go from there. Most tuners are too cumbersome and require large batteries or external power(pedals). In addition I couldn't use those on my acoustics. Snark solves all of these problems. The display is colorful and easy to read and hides neatly behind the headstock. There is also a visual tap metronome that shows a beating heart in sync with the tempo. I can easily move it from electric to acoutic, and Amazon's pricing is so low I am considering getting one for each of my guitars. This is one of the few 5 star ratings I've given any product on Amazon and I rate a lot.
