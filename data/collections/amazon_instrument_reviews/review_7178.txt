I bought one of those padded Fender leather straps (it says FS1 CANADIAN leather on the back). I thought these Fender strap locks would complement the strap, but because of the padding the thread on the strap-lock wasn't high enough for the nut to reach. I finally got the nut to get a hold of the top of the thread and although it works I don't trust that its enough. If you have a padded leather strap I don't recommend these.
