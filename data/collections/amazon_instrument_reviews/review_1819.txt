After playing for years with Elixir Nanoweb 80/20's, I decided to experiment with a few different coated strings. I tried the Elixir Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze, Dean Markley Alchemy Gold Phosphor (now discontinued) and these EXP16s. Ultimately, I preferred the Nanoweb Phosphor Bronze the best, but the EXP16 are cheaper and the difference didn't warrant the extra cost, so I decided to stick with these for now.  I wasn't a fan of the Alchemys because of their rough texture and high tension. The EXP16s are smooth and have a very playable tension, although not as smooth and easy as the Elixir 80/20's.  As far as longevity, these seem to last me about 2 months, which is on par with other coated strings I've tried, except for the Elixir 80/20's which average about 3 months. Uncoated strings last me about a month.Depending on the style of play, I prefer brighter or warmer strings, but I'd rank the EXP16s somewhere in the middle. It's a good balance for both strumming and fingerstyle. Even though they don't project as well as the Elixir 80/20s, they have a very agreeable tone without some of the harsh overtones. For live use with a pickup I'd be more inclined to use the Elixirs, but for unplugged or mic'ed use I like the tone of these.
