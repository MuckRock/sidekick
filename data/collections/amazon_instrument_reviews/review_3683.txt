This is my first guitar stand and I have to say I am pretty happy with it.  It's made of good quality metal and you can tell it's much higher quality than the price tells it to be.  The neck strap and the base are excellent.  Made of great padding to pad the bottom and can put any guitar base on there.  Look at the other reviews and you won't be disappointed.  It didn't smell like the other reviews said either.
