I really like this tuner but it is kinda bulky. Very obvious. Calls a lot of attention to itself, all GIANT and red.Still, I can't fault it's tuning prowess. It's quick and pretty on the money. It replaced my Roland Boss Tu-12h.Well more handy for tuning my sweet La Patrie nylon strung &#34;Motif&#34;Would buy again,  but I'd really prefer a more subdued  color.
