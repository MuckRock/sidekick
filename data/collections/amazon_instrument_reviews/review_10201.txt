The apogee Jam works great and it sounds great. The operation is very simple: you plug in your guitar and plug in to your Mac or ios device. I have mine hooked up to my MacBook, running Garage Band. If there is any latency I can't hear it. It works beautifully. Apogee is known for making good music products and this Jam is no exception. I was able to plug in a microphone (line level) into this as well and record my vocals. Likewise, it worked well with my 4-string bass as well. I was able to record a whole song in no time. For a simple audio interface, this is affordable and dependable.
