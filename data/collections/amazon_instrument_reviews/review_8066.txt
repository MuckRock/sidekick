I love my HD500. Got it a while back but have just started to explore it's capabilities. Sounds very very good and am happy about the fact that additional tones can be downloaded at their website. There are so many options, I spend hours just experimenting and trying different things. The possibilities are endless. Wonderful. I love it. Am sure you will too. ENJOY!!!
