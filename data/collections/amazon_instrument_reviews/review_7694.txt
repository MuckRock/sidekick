Great flatwound strings. I put these on my J-bass over a year ago and they still sound and feel awesome. They are stainless steel and very smooth. I have never tried other flats except for chromes on my Tele and Fender tapewounds on my fretless, so my view may be biased. For what I paid and how they sound, feel, and have lasted, I am very pleased.
