The previous reviewer obviously got a defective case. The case I got works incredibly well, and always keeps the guitar well protected, and my back comfortable while carrying it. It has a lot of space, and it looks pretty good too. I'd recommend it to anyone!EDIT* I've had 3 good years with this bag, and it has still yet to rip on me.
