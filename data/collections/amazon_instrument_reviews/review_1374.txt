Unfortunately, the first one of these I ordered from Amazon arrived with two of the bottles having leaked their contents all over the place. Take two! The second set I received was in great condition, and I'm really surprised with the amount of product you get for the low cost. This kit literally has everything you will need (except new strings of course...) to keep your guitar looking and sounding great.
