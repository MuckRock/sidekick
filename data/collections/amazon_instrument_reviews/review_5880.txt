Not much to say about a guitar strap... except I had planned to use it on a Simga acoustic without a pin at the neck. I ended up using the strap on my Strat for the acoustic and this one is on the Strat. This one doesn't come with a wrap or tie for the nut so, it is for use with a guitar with a pin at both sides of the body. If you need to secure one end at the headstock, this is not an option. It is comfortable though.
