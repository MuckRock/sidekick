I ordered TM50BK unit but after a couple of delays with my local delivery agent, decided to buy a unit locally which turned out to be the Korg Beat Boy.The Beat Boy is everything that this unit is and then some. In addition to the metronome and tuner, it has a record function and drum tracks, in all 100 different patterns. The units have an almost identical front panel with the metronome patterns in with the drum options, the extra buttons for the record and an external mic for acoustic instruments.Had I seen the Beat Boy first, I would have ordered it instead as I was looking for a drum machine anyway. The functions which are shared between the 2 units work really well, the tuner is accurate and fast, and can't fault the metronome.I will probably keep the TM50BK as a spare, but I'm also glad my local shippers have prolonged the wait. If you just want a metronome and tuner, this is a fine unit, but if you're considering a drum machine too, look at the Beat Boy before making any decisions.
