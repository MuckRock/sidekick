I'm a beginner ukulele player, and I bought one of the cheap ukulele's here on Amazon. It didn't sound very good, and I didn't know if it was the instrument or the strings. It was the strings, and I'm very glad I replaced them with these strings. They make my ukulele sound like it should, and it holds tuning pretty well. I'm very happy with the purchase.
