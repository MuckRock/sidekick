This is a very good quality, nice sounding delay. You can get that classic "slapback" sound or dial you in some nice lead delays for that classic rock sound. Very simple to operate and that's what makes these Joyo pedals a "joy" to use. Nothing fancy, but simple and to the point. Another great selling point to me is that they are absolutely "true bypass". I have bought the cheaper, "plastic" pedals and they make noise. They say that they are true bypass, but they are not. These babies are dead quiet! I run mine through the effects loop on my Bugera V22 tube amp and it sounds great! I also own the Joyo Vintage OD (TubeScreamer clone) and it is great as well. Highly recommend!!!
