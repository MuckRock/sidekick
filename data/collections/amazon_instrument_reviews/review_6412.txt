This Orange Micro Crush amp lives up to it's name. It's little bitty, about a third the size of the Roland Micro Cube, but it's plenty loud. Surprisingly loud really, it's amazing that much sound comes out of that thing. Of course it doesn't have all the bells and whistles of the Micro Cube, it's basically got a clean channel, an overdrive channel and a tuner. Then a volume knob a tone knob and that's it. The over drive gives a good sound but I like to run pedals through it anyway. It's missing reverb, which I would like to have, but it's far from a deal breaker.I have no issues with the build quality, it feels solid as a rock. Of course it's size and trademark Orange color make it look like a toy, it's definitely a capable little amp. Definitely a keeper!
