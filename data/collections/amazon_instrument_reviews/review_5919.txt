First the goods: Sturdy leather construction just cant be beat. the color is spot on with the pictures shown.The Bads: It's a bit short, I have it on acoustic guitar that the forward mount is the &#34;shoe lace around the head stock&#34; method, I had to max this strap out to make the span. I'm a bigger guy, so a smaller person shouldn't have this problem. Then there's the whole friction of suede on clothing thing I hadn't considered. It drags and pulls your shirt really bad, making it a bit of a pain to get the guitar on a positioned where you want it to hang. That problem is not specific to this strap, but the material its made out of. It's high quality, but I didn't consider it trying to pull my shirt off. If had to do over again, I'd pass.
