I have owned a few of these and they hold up perfectly. What I love is they do not introduce noise in the signal path, and have some nice touches in the way they are made.One of those 'nice touches' is a strain relief at both ends, which will prolong the life of the cable as well as prevent micro breaks in the conductor that can (and will) introduce noise and static eventually. The plugs are also of the highest quality. They mate perfectly with 1/4" receptacles on guitars and amps.I mentioned that these are for inside playing. What I mean is for outside gigs on rough concrete, cobblestone and similar surfaces the outer jacket will fray as the cable is dragged across the surface. That is not a negative aspect of the jacket as much as a reality of the material from which the jacket is made.Otherwise this is a bargain when you consider the quality, price and performance. Get one as a spare if for no other reason because I think you will be pleased with it.
