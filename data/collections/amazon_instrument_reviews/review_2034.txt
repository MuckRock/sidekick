I have an older version of this model, but it works great.  I opted to use more heavy weight wall anchors that I got from Home depot.  2 hangers rated to hold up to 75 lbs each equals 150 lbs worth of peace of mind!  The hanger itself that I bought was used, so it was already assembled, so I can't comment too much on the assembly process.  I bought 2 of them, and each holds my precious basses with tender care and worry-free security!  And no, I don't own stock in the company!  :-)
