Ive been using this polish since the early 80's. It doesn't smell the way some do and works fantastic on all of my guitars. Wonderful polish and has not hurt my guitars. What has hurt my guitars is me dropping them or sweating all over them, but this polish? No way. Martin knows what they're doing. I use it on my expensive nitrocellulose finishes.
