This set of strings is fantastic. I've been playing for over ten years now, and have tried everything from Elixirs, to D'Addario, to Martin, to John Pearse (you see where I'm going with this?)and many more.I have to say that for the money, these strings are in a class of their own.  When I first started playing I loved the coated strings.  I wouldn't buy anything but Elixirs for years!  Then I got married and money became tight, and for $15 a pop, a set Elixirs wasn't looking as good as they used to.So I tried every other set of strings under the sun for about three years.I finally landed on these Earthwoods by Ernie Ball.  Amazing!They are not coated, but after a while I got used to that, and now actually prefer non-coated strings.These really do bring out the "earthy" tones of my dreadnought.  And the Medium Light set is just perfect!  Nice size high E string so I don't feel like I'm going to snap it when I do a pull off, and good bass response.All in all a fantastic set of strings that you can't afford not to try.And at $5, why wouldn't you give them a shot?
