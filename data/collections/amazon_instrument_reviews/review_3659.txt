We picked up the "XCG4 Guitar Stand" for my daughter's acoustic guitar and it is exactly what was needed! Here are my observations:Pros -+ Stable; once setup and tightened down, this is very sturdy+ Adjustable; the height and base can be configured to accommodate the guitar+ Security Strap; has a rubber strap that hold the neck securlyCons -- Slight chemical smell that dissipates after a few daysThis is a good value for a very functional and good looking guitar stand.Highly Recommended!CFH
