While the Tascam US-322 Audio Interface appears to be a powerful tool for home based recording, it also appears that it is designed to work only in tandem with the included Cubase LE software. I am not a novice at home recording, as I have used many devices from 4 track cassettes to ProTools setups over the years. Here is a rundown of my disappointing experience:1) plugged into my iPad using the camera kit USB connector - got "device not compatible with iPad" message. Too bad, but I can still use my ART USB interface which works quite well with Garageband.2) installed driver on my old, G4 Mac running 10.5.8; opened Garageband, got  "no input" message.Could not evaluate the Cubase software, as it requires Mac OS 10.6.8. If I get a new computer, I will update my review. Until then, I'm disappointed.
