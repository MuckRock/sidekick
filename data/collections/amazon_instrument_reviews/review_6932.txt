The mic does exactly what I wanted it to do.  The mic has a headphone jack.  Having the headphone jack is essential to making quality recordings. Also, I like having the two polar patterns, switchable from cardioid to omni.I did have to back off a bit in proximity to the mic, as my voice is powerful.  Once, I got the hang of it I had no problems.I did find the bundled Cakewalk software useless.  Please refer to my review of" Cakewalk Music Creator 6" here on amazon.com.  It works great with my new "Acoustica Mixcraft 5 Audio MIDI Music Recording Software V 5."Overall, this is an awesome product.
