I wasn't quite sure what to expect but have a few old guitars with pretty weathered looking fingerboards.  I figured I'd give this a try.  I am so glad I did.  I could not believe how much residue was on the rag after I cleaned the fret board, yuk.  Then I used the 02 treatment product to treat it and it really brought out the natural color.  I'd like to say it looks like new, but the guitar is a 1967 so that would be a stretch.But it looks a heck of a lot better, almost new.  I used it on one of my less valuable acoustics, but it's still a '67 USA made Fender.  I have such faith in this that I'm going to do my '77 Gibson acoustic next.Then I have a couple of electrics I will do when I change strings on them.  This stuff is great.
