Having recently purchased an Epiphone EL-00 I went about changint the bridge pins and bridge itself from the installed plastic units to Graph Tech's Tusq material. It is hard to emphasize just how much they have improved the tone of what was a very good instrument to begine with. The top resonates with a greater sustain due to the vibrational transfer of the Tusq bridge and pins, the note to note defination went from very good to exceptional. This was one of the best modifications I have made to an instrument in many years of tweaking my instruments. I have a nut on the way to complete the upgrade...I can barely wait. I highly recommend this product it will give your instrument a new voice.
