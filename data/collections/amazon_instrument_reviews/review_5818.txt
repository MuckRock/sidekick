Good price and sound. Classic behringer plastic housing I haven't had a problem with ever but I don't dog my stuff... Favor this over built in analog drives, nicer crunch and dirt that's flexible. Fair to say real tube is the best, but for analog and practice amps this does put some life in the tone.  Can't say for metal as I'm not so into, but everything else find this fits the bill.
