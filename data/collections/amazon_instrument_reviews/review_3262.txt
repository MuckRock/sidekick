The Martin M140 strings are good strings.  They play well and last reasonably well.  I change strings about every 2 to 4 months and play about an hour a day.  These strings lasted abotu 2 and a half months before they started to sound flat.  They did stay in tune well the whole time I had them on my guitar.  I had them on my Yamaha FG700S.
