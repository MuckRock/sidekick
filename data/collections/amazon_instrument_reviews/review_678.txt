The case is hard on the outside and soft on the inside as it should be. The pocket inside is nice for holding accessories. It does include a lock on the middle latch, but somehow mine eventually stopped working, as the lock isn't very good quality. The lock cylinder itself fell inside the lock and can no longer be used. Otherwise great case, highly recommended.
