I bought 3 of these to store in various bass cases. I use them after a session or practice along with some guitar cleaner.. Sadly, I could not find any untreated cloths locally so I had these shipped through prime. These cloths are gentle and prevent scratching the finish unlike some of the microfiber types I see here and in stores that tend to leave streaks and in some cases scratches on the guitar.
