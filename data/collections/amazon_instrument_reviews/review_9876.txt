I play using this device. It is portable, so I always have it with me. I tune the A to 432, and this works well for that. Has a tuner and a metronome. What's not to love. Best to carry a cable to plug into the guitar, unless you are in a quiet area. It is sensitive, and will pick up ambient sounds to give false readings. This is a good thing: it's sensitive.
