I don't know what I would do without this little shelf on my music stand.  I works on my non-Manhasset sold-shelf stand, holds my pencil/highlighter/flute swab & even occasionally a small speaker set that I have for my phone.  It easily slides over the lip of my music stand and is reasonably secure.  Very well worth the $$.
