I had previously owned it Digitech jam man, I also try the boss.After seeing demos of this item on YouTube I decided  I'll give it a try, I can always return it if I didn't like it.The unit is extremely small but don't let that fool you. This unit is a high-quality all metal construction it has simple easy operation and it works flawlessly. You get up to five minutes to record a loop for loops and you can get an infinite number of overdubs. Let's be serious how many people really Loop for over five minutes?The unit is transparent when turned off I would highly recommend this Looper it's well worth the money.
