I paid only $29 and it is small and convenient. I was impressed with the sound.At first I played it with my Line 6 15 watt amp. I didn't like it cause of the squealing. But then I read how you use it and all that. Boy! It worked great.I use it with a Tascam US 100 USB plugin to my computer and I get a good sound for practice.I still like my Line 6 amp though for more sounds and sustain. But this is a bargain and small.You can use this with any USB audio interface.If you like AC/DC you would like this. There are different amp sounds you can get.Cheap and convenient I'am not disappointed.My opinion is that it sounds best with a USB guitar audio device such as Tascams US 100.
