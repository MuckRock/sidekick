I've always used these dunlop picks, I've tried other ones like fender, other dunlop picks as well but these just feel right, I've never like the thicker picks or the picks with the weird grips on them these just feel right when playing, give them a try! ... if not you'll just wind up with a cool little turtle tortex sticker instead
