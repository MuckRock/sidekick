I was previously using a Rocksmith USB Cable, but wanted a specific cable for my iMac. This unit definitely fits the bill, and from what I can hear when playing, has an even lower latency than the RS cable. I was getting a little unwanted slapback with the RS cable, but this unit seems to have taken care of that. It's also quite nice to have a headphone jack right up front for quiet practice times.The software that comes with this Interface is a joke, and is about as useful as an AOL disc. Since I use Logic Pro X and MainStage 3 it wasn't a loss to me, but if you are buying this interface for the fact it comes with &#34;Amp Tones&#34;, you might want to look somewhere else. I couldn't even get the software to load on my 2013 iMac.
