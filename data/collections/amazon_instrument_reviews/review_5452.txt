It does what it says it will, but it's still not a great pedalboard solution. The distance between the plugs is sometimes too short. Also, if you're not using ALL  the plugs, you've got a dangling end you've got to try and stash or tie off. Again it's a good item for what it does but it has inherent problems if you're pedalboard has varying distances between pedals.
