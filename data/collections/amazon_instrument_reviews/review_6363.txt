Here's what you'll need to know about this product if you're interested in getting one.....1.  The 'head' accommodates multiple tuning peg sizes due to the slot config.  That's a good thing.2.  The trigger is a rocker switch..... so you can wind and unwind,....quickly.  That's a good thing, for the most part.3.  It is not variable speed.  One speed.  FAST RPM!  It takes some practice and patience.  Nothing special, just the will to get used to it.  Initially, and until you get used to it, you'll have the head jumping off the peg.  Don't 'fret' (bad pun)... a few minutes of rehearsal with it and you'll get to like it.  I've opted to pull the trigger in short bursts so as to refrain from having a string change remind you of a NASCAR tire change in the pit.... and especially because when you get close to the desired tension you need to go slowly so as not to over-run it.I would have much preferred a device that has a two-position switch.... 'slow' and 'fast' position on the trigger for more control.  I've rated it 4-stars, not 5, not because there is anything 'wrong' with it or that it doesn't work.  It does all that the advertisements say it will.  It's the aspect of the device I had to find out the hard way that keeps me from giving it a 'perfect' score.All in all, be patient and all will be well.  Realistically, I don't need to change a set of strings in just a couple of minutes.... I've got hours if I chose to.  I suspect most folks are in the same position.  If you're a 'roadie' for a big group, I could see the need,...the need for speed. But, alas, I'm not.  So, like some of the other things I've purchased along the way, I now have a new toy.  I works.  I'm satisfied...... for now.DP
