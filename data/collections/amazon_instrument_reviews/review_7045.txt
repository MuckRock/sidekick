Was looking for something slightly improved over the Snark, but still easier to use and lower cost than a strobe tuner.Works well to quickly tune and still zero in on the correct pitch.Appears the tuner is a AW2 and the G (guitar) function is in that the clip fits a guitar headstock.Works as anticipated. Easy to get that last bit of fine tuning.
