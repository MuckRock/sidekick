While I wish the bases came in different colors, I really like these hangars. They look good, and perform well. I hang Strats on them and have not experienced any problems (think I saw a video on Youtube that said Strat headstocks could slip).Easy to install, and hanging and releasing is a no-brainer. Have three of these Hercules hangers.
