I don't do heavy gigging just home studio play but I have had no issues with quality or sound.  It looks cool and sounds just fine and clear.  I like the metal connecters, they are easy to plug in and pull out at have a nice heft.It is not a super high quality cord but it does an excellent job for the price.  I will be buying these again.
