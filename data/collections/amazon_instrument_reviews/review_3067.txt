I works ok but you have to observe a few details when using it.Notice the curve of the Mute and the curve of the top of the bridge.It only is supposed to go on one way, to match the shape of the bridge.Try reversing it and you'll see what I mean.Also, you have to press the mute down almost all the way to the top ofthe bridge, otherwise it won't mute the sound very much.If used correctly, this mute works well.
