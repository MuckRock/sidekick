Real good variation from full out (RAT like) to not so much saturation. The treble and bass control make HUGE sound differences. Its plastic so dont jump on it! The 1 & 2 ( I dont use the boost but its cool) make it that much more versatile. You wont be sorry! Almost bought a Big Muff or another RAT but Im glad I spent WAY less money.
