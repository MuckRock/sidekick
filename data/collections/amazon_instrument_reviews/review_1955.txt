I have a Boss OD which I realize now matches well with my little Vox tube amp, so I use this Bad Monkey pedal when I go direct for low level or headphone playing. Good price, good tone, pretty versatile, but I like the mid boost and harmonics I get from the Boss. The BM might work better with solid state.
