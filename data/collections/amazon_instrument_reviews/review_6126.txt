Awesome tuner, really fast and responsive. Best of all it is accurate, enough so that using this for setups has resulted in a much quicker easier process than I had anticipated. Nice and bright so I can clearly see it on stage in the dark. Occasionally I get a small pop when I engage it but not that frequently. This pedal feels good and sturdy too, I really cannot see anyone breaking it unless you feel the need to leap from the monitors on to the switch. Price is easy enough that if anything should happen to it, I would not think twice about picking another one up.
