This AC adapter, in my opinion, should not even qualify to be reviewed since we all know it should be included with the product it is powering. That being said, it functions as it was intended to, which is to power a Yamaha PSRE333 61-key portable keyboard. It fits perfectly and stays put, all while transmitting electrical current from my home's 110v outlet into the aforementioned Yamaha keyboard. Thanks for reading.SPO
