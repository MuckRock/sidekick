50+ years giggingowned it all 4 or 5 times :)wanted a cheap delay pedal to go into the fx loop of a newly purchased blackstar ht 5c r.since i've purchased several joyo pedals in the last year i looked for a joyo digital delay.it works perfectly, doesnt color the sound, silent switching and the knobs give all the control you'd ever need. it's well built and i expect it to last longer than me :)i highly reccomend this delay pedal.
