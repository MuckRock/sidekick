I usually play my Jazz Bass fingerstyle, but there are songs where I prefer a pick, especially when I need speed and accuracy. Until I found the hard Wedgie rubber pick, I used a heavy Fender pick, but didn't like the sharp pick sound very much.I bought a set of soft, medium and hard Wedgie picks to try out and I'm really happy with the results. I greatly prefer the soft Wedgie on the Uke, I like the medium on my nylon string guitar and the hard Wedgie's really nice for my Jazz Bass. I still use hard plastic picks for my electric and steel string acoustic guitars, but the Wedgie's are fantastic for when I need a more fingerlike sound on the other instruments. I prefer the 3.1mm wedgie picks since the 5mm picks feel a bit too thick for my tastes, but that's entirely subjective.I'd love to see a slightly larger version of the pick someday, but it still works very well for me.
