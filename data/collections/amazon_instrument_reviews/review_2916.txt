First time I ordered these was in a larger order, and Amazon forgot to put them in the box. Oops! I contacted their customer support people and they overnighted me a replacement set of strings at no extra charge. Thank you, Amazon!I like the tone of D'Addario's 80/20 bronze strings. I've been playing more bluegrass-y guitar lately, so I've switched to mostly using phosphor bronze, but these strings have a great warmth that I really enjoy. I also notice that electronic tuners have a much easier time picking up the notes from the 80/20 strings.Amazon has the best price on these, and they're inexpensive enough that I can afford to change strings whenever I feel like it. I like their tone, and they react well with my skin chemistry so they last a long time.
