A breeze to install on my mac mini, simple to use with Garageband. The bad reviews here are bizarre, written by inept people who either can't handle the install or have a buggy PC or OS. I was up and running 5 minutes after I tore off the shrink wrap from the packaging.There's plenty of specs/details/videos on the interwebs about this software, go do some research, see if you like it. It's way better than the drum kits that come with Garageband and there's plenty of kits to expand with. I got the Vintage Rock kit and I love it - almost as much as I love pizza, which I will marry some day. I like a cheese pizza. Some call it "plain" but with the right blend of sauce, cheese and crust, there's nothing plain about it - it's somewhat complex, much like myself. We are a perfect match, pizza and me. We go together like shoo bop shoo wadda wadda yipitty boom de boom. I'm not exclusively a thin crust guy, sometimes I dig something a bit thick or an all out deep dish.The only weak point in this pizza I mean software is that you can't do a cymbal swell. Apparently, it's the same with all these virtual kits, regardless of brand, but it would be nice if someone (toontrack) would address it by including a "side stick" attack on the crashes. If you try to do a cymbal swell, you hear the initial stick-on-cymbal "ting" with each attack, so it's kind of a "ting-ting-ting-ting" sound instead of "bwooooosssshhhhh." I'm sure I can find a bwoosh loop without a ting-ting. Bwoosh loop - no ting-ting. Do I get a fortune cookie with that?Pizza time!Ohhh, myyyy loooove... my darlin'... I hun-ger for.... your crust....
