I did my research on this buy. I looked at a lot of reviews, as well as youtube reviews comparing other headphones, and these seemed to be the clear favorites over other competitors such as Beats Pro (in which you're spending at least $100 of the total $200 on just the name alone, such a rip-off if you ask me). These are very clear and fine tuned. My only knock on these is that they could use a little more padding for the top of my head.
