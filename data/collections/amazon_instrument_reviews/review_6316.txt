There isn't much to get excited about in a guitar stand, however, it does it's job and the price was right. I purchased four and they were all delivered on time. Each adjusted to, and held, its guitar securely. I have found the stand to be very stable. The welds seem secure ad the materiel heavy enough to do the job. My music teacher has a similar stand which cost him 4x as much. It's does not appear to be of better quality.
