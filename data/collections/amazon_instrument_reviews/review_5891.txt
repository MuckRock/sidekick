**So after reading a couple comments on this review it's obvious that my original review was somewhat irrelevant being that I was using the strap for the wrong application.  According to the first comment and verified from their companies website(which I should have done before buying) the strap is meant for a bass guitar.  Please don't purchase this thinking it will work for a standard acoustic or probably even an acoustic bass.  Amazon should have clarified in their item description.  Thanks for the comments educating me and sorry for the misleading review.**I'm not a very tall person and this strap is just incredibly short.  I currently own two other leather straps and they have the potential to be lengthened so that my acoustic would hang down by my waist or so, even though I usually play it about midway on my torso.  I don't NEED my straps to be super long but this thing makes it hard to even put the guitar on.  It just feels a little tight and crammed when I wear it.  I'll probably end up adding a string at one end just to give myself an extra 4 inches or so.  The leather itself isn't a bad quality, but it's not the finest.  I'd suggest dropping an extra $20 or so and getting a very high quality strap.**I just wanted to clarify that I was reviewing this product in regards to my acoustic guitar.  I have read some other reviews and it seems that those using it for an electric guitar have no complaints, but being that my acoustic is a good 2-3 times as thick as an electric, it does not serve my needs.
