Works great.  I didn't use the monster size wall board screw and it holds fine with the small furnished screws.  Next time I'm buying the all metal one and daisy chaining them to a board so I don't have to make tons of holes in the wall for my half dozen guitars.  For now I'm hanging one on the wall with this and it's fine.  Wood is nice quality.  I notice the price is almost 2x as much if you walk in the guitar center.
