I like this for getting rid of all those extra adaptors you have to have a special power strip for, and it works well for most of my Ibanez, MXR and Boss pedals that have an outside adaptor socket.  It doesn't seem to work so well with my Vox wah, my old MXR Distortion Plus and my Fulltone pedals. I'm using the 9v battery adaptor for the wah and my Dist+, and I get a really weird random squealy noise from the wah (not the same one you get when the wah is not playing well with another pedal in your chain) and intermittant operating problems with the Dist+.  I get a slightly louder hum from the Fulltone pedals when they're on, but my newer Boss/Ibanez/MXR pedals have no issues at all.  The One Spot is not a regulated power supply (if it was, they'd say so), so maybe that's the culprit; not sure.
