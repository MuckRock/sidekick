I like the sound of this pedal and the ability to get the right over drive sound I want. I've used it with my reissue 70's Fender Strat plugged into my 1968 vintage Marshal 50 watt head and a slanted 4 cab. Love the sound. I am also using this pedal with my Ibanez GB 10 arch top jazz guitar and I am amazed with how good of an over drive I can get!! I've also owned a tube screamer, but I like this one better!!
