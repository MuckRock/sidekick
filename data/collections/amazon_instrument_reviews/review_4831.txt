This mixer has four mic inputs. It has some fun effects. This mixer comes with a 80Hz filter and a 3-band equalizer on the mic channels. It has a FX-send that can be used as a mono output if you only need mono. I do not hear any external noise. It has a durable metalic case.  This mixer has great audio.
