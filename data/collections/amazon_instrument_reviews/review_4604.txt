Works great, but it is a little annoying to have to tighten and loosen the screw to use every time.Some responses to comments I've seen in the reviews:--I've had mine for 5 years, used moderately, and the wear on the metal from the bottom of the screw is negligible. Haven't put a pad there or anything.--The manual screw functionality does, I feel, give an added level of control...you can make it very tight to ensure no buzz.--However, range of motion is on the wide side. To get it to properly capo the first fret on my acoustic, I have to put it right on the edge of the 1st string, and screw it down all the way, and it does sometimes leave some buzz.The price is nice though, so I would recommend it as a perfectly fine capo.
