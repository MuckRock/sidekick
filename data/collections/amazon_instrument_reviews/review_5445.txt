I was new to pedal effects, new to pedal boards, and new to the challenge of how to power it all.  I did my research and settled on Pedal Train for the board (the Mini, with case) and the One Spot for power.  This bundle--including an 8-pedal chain, a few adapters and the power supply--does it all.  In fact, it may be overkill.  I only have 5 pedals, so I have to hide/secure the rest of the chain with twist ties.  And the adapters, never used 'em.  But it is a complete kit.  If you need more than this, I don't know what to tell ya.
