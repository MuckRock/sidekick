This capo works just fine. The only downside is the same as with most capos...it requires some fine-tuning to get it work on different guitars. The only one I've found that doesn't is the Kyser...my "go to" capo for years. Because of its design, that capo adjusts to any guitar (acoustic vs. electric, thin neck vs thick, etc) easily. The only downside of that capo is that it sacrifices a tiny bit of perfect intonation for the sake of ease of use.This capo has a similar "pinch" design (spring-loaded), but doesn't adjust as easily to different guitar/neck sizes. It has a wheel that allows for it to be tightened or widened as the guitar needs. This allows for a bit more accuracy of intonation, but at the expense of ease of use. It's certainly not difficult or extremely time consuming, but it's not a capo you want to use to quickly swap in between songs.So, all said, I still prefer my Kyser. It allows for much faster changing, which for me is worth the slight offset in intonation accuracy. But this might be a better option if you're in a studio or won't ever need to use a capo for more than one song at a time (or don't plan to use it on more than one guitar in the first place).
