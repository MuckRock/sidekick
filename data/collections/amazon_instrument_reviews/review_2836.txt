I can now say I have used several others - coated Martins, flat wounds, smooth wounds, EXP, Elixir, etc. These are pretty cheap and sound like a million bucks. Their tone is slightly bright but not as &#34;harpsichord&#34; as the EXP. I am done experimenting. These are the strings for Takamine guitars.
