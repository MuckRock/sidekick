There is no doubt in my mind that you will be impressed with the quality this microphone has to offer your home studio or voice-over applications. It does well and minimizing the air pressure impact of the room and it humbly presents any voice with great clarity and a bassy tone. NOTE: use a good preamp or a external EQ
