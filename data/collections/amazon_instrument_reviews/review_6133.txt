I'm on my second US600 pedal, after the first one broke.  I plugged in a cheap cord into the input, and when I went to pull it out, it was stuck.  So...I applied a lot of force to pull the cord out.  When I did that, I heard something break inside the pedal, and when I went to use it again, it didn't work.I pulled the pedal apart and inspected it to see about repairs, but ended up opting to buy a new one instead.  Even though the pedal has cheap housing (which worries me a little bit), the Boss equivalent of this pedal is 3 times as much.  So since this isn't a "staple" effect in my pedal board, I'm happy to go with something cheaper for now.Pros:Cheap price- sounds greatCons:Cheap housing - may break if used a lot
