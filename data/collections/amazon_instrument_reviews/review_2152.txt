I have been playing guitar for three decades and It seems to me that D'Addario has been around.I use light strings when I want more control and easier bends for blues songs on my electric guitar.  Light strings in my hands do seem to wear out sooner, probably because I used them in this manner.  It is great that Amazon stocks these, making ordering convenient.  These come in a stay fresh vacuum pack, so ordering more than one and keeping an extra set around is prudent.
