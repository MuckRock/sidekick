I gig a lot and since I am a grey haired musician I need to sit when it will be over an hour of playing. This seat works great for me and folds up and can be disassembled with very little fuss. The back rest support is nice, too. For the price its well constructed and perfect for the solo musician doing gigs all over the country.
