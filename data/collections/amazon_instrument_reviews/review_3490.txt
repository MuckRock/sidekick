Monster Standard instrument cable is amazingly good for the price. It's flexible (unlike some of their more expensive cable), quiet, solid, and durable. It's much more transparent to tone than many other more expensive cables. For the money, it's really hard to beat. I won't waste money on the more expensive cables again.
