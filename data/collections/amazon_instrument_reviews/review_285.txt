I started using Kyser capos a couple of years ago and have never looked back since. I now own several of them and have not had any problems with any of them. They work great on acoustic and electric guitars and they have survived the many children I teach lessons to even though they get treated rather rough at times. Great capos. You won't be disappointed.
