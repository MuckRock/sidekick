I play guitar and bass, but the gitpicker in me envies full-time bassists because they almost never break strings, and bass strings hold their tone far longer than guitar strings. The price has also come down to where you can spend well under a hundred bucks a year on strings and always have fresh tone rich with harmonics. You don't know how good you've got it! And these D'Ad's are very good all-round strings, though they make a lot more noise than flatwounds and even "normal" nickel wound, so they're not for sloppy fingers.Very nice for funky players and those who want more definition and edge, these FlexSteels ring nicely and I like that the bottom E is a tad thicker at 105 than the usual light set's 100. Because these are pretty bright, that extra oomph is nice. And I'm a big believer that the amp can fix string issues much more easily with bass than guitar, so merely dialing out a little treble or even rolling off the volume a bit on your bass will take care of that. But if you're popping and slapping, these come through loud and clear. I really like the feel of the low E when I thumb pop with these.I play a P-bass with my index, middle and thumb, and these punch nicely at that scale length. The pickups also like them, and they get plenty loud, with full definition and plenty of top end, but not brittle. With a Trace Elliot or other high-def amp, these would be very unforgiving for all but the most exact players. I bet Marcus would kill with them.I think these are perfect for funk, and excellent for almost all rock styles. Obviously flats are better for jazz, but these make a good all-around string and for less than 20 clams they're a great deal.
