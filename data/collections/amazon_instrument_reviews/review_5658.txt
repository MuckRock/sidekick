Unfortunately I wasn't aware that slides come in all sizes and got a medium when I need the large. The medium fits over my pinky finger and while that's okay I prefered it fit over my index finger where I'd have more control.I cannot fault the slide for my foolish choice so I'll pass this onto my son or someone who can use it and get myself the larger Dunlop 212 Slide.
