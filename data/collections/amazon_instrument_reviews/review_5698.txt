I've owned these for several years and found them sufficient for mixing purposes -- so long as I keep using reference songs for comparison ... that's because by themselves, the ATH-M50 don't have a flat frequency response. They're flatter than most phones under a hundred, but you will find that they're a bit too middy and lacking in lower treble regions compared with a good set of studio monitors.Fortunately, I found that this deficiency can be fixed with a corrective EQ curve. Load up a parametric EQ and do the following: [+1dB @ 80Hz Q of 5],  [+1.5dB @ 350Hz Q of 2], [-2.5 dB @ 1kHz Q of 1], [+1dB @ 3kHz Q of 1], [+2dB @ 6.5kHz Q of 3.5], and [+1.5dB @ 15kHz Q of 3].  Save this as a preset.If you listen to reference songs with this, you'll find a more pleasing, balanced, 3D kind of sound compared to the original.  I base this correction curve on published frequency response graphs of the ATH-M50. The proof that this worked is that now these headphones sound a lot like my good studio monitors. They translate better with the correction curve active.The bass on these is solid and seems to go down to 20Hz or so, more felt than heard. Subsonic thumps feel like head motion more than sound. This is where these headphones are better than studio monitors, unless you have a well treated room with a good sub. I therefore use these headphones to adjust bass, in relation to the reference songs. I also use them for editing slight sounds (pops, clicks) and getting reverb tails right, and with help panning tracks -- they are VERY good for this, like a magnifying glass.The foam pads and black 'paint' on the headband will crack and fall off after 2 years. I wrapped black sports tape around the headband, works well. Replacement pads can be bought on Amazon. So the padding material coating could have been better made.  That plus the middy frequency response is why I give 4 stars instead of 5.  But I still think they're the best headphones for mixing and tracking under a couple hundred.
