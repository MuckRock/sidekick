Why not? For the price and some reviews I found online, I had to try this pedal.  I bought one myself and it has remained on my pedalboard since I've bought it.  NOTE : I recently put this right after my wah and before my dirt boxes and I've found that it does two things; 1. The vibe sound doesn't get smooshed and retains a more rounded sound and 2. any volume drop you might experience having this after some od/distortion seems to be less.  I suggest playing around and trying this pedal in different places on your pedal chain to see what works best for you.  For me, it will stay before my od pedals and fuzz.  Do yourself a favor and check out some youtube demos of this.  Mine is musicman587....this is the pedal AFTER pedals, but you'll get a good idea of the general settings I use it on.
