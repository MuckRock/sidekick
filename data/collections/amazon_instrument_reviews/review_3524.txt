This is a great pick for all those that use picks, but need a softer sound occasionally.  Much easier than getting your fingers all tangled up.  The only negative is the way they seem to be packed here.  They come in three colors and the colors stand for soft, medium, hard.  They also come in 3 and 5mm which is the size of the grip thickness (where you grip the pick.)  The white is soft, the medium grey is medium, and the dark grey is hard.  I use the white and medium grey in 3.1mm and find that easy to adjust too.  They are soft and they do wear fairly quickly, but you just keep playing them or do a little cutting to sharpen them back up.  You get a nice soft tone and, just like using any other plectrum, you develop a picking style to get various tones (double bass, acoustic, finger style, etc.  I use the soft picks for a smooth tone, and the medium pick for a deep jazzy sound (think Motown.)  I never leave home without at least three of each in my gig bag.For a real trip, if you are able to finger pick, try out the Jam Cat pick holder sold here.  It is so easy to switch from finger to pick in an instant and it is always there when you need to rock it up a bit.
