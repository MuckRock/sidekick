Oh, quick note: this capo is meant for instruments with radiused, NOT flat, necks.  That said, it works fine on a non-radiused ukulele.I've been using only Kyser capos for many years now.  They don't fall off, they don't usually pull strings sharp, but they do grip TIGHT and can damage some finishes.This capo is easy on & easy off with the pistol grip, has a correct supportive shape for the back of the neck so it won't damage finishes, and has adjustable tension.  I backed off the tension as much as possible, set it on the neck, made one adjustment and it was perfect.  Since I can adjust the tension, I have no worries about it pulling strings sharp.I only wish it was a bit shorter for Ukulele neck widths! ;-)
