As a musician I wanted both a PA and an instrument amp, but I also wanted extra inputs and outputs. This has it all. Whether you want to output TO a PA or FROM a PA...... TO your guitar amp or FROM it.....and even play your MP3 player while you play AND sing. If you need more inputs, then just output a mixer to it. The tone controls are nice and the bass you can get is quite amazing for a 5.5" speaker. Link to a bass amp or sub-woofer and you definitely have full sound. Certainly loud enough for a 1-man-band gig and definitely enough to supply an outdoor party with some music. I know it's a copy of other speaker/amps... but its a Behringer. I think it's a wonderful and adequate Must-Have for any musician.
