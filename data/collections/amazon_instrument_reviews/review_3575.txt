Just got mine - fast shipping from amazon thank you :)It has a great weight to it very similar to a real piano.  I was a little lost when i plugged it into my Yamaha S90ES - similar to the newer versionYamaha S90XS 88-key Balanced Weighted Hammer Action synth(I SHOULD OF READ THE DIRECTIONS ON THE BOX)  - the polarity needed to be changed on the pedal found on the back!woops - i was in constant sustain there for a minute - scared me that my pedal was broken.anyways it instantly makes my awesome electronic keyboard sound so much like a real deal pricey piano!awesome!
