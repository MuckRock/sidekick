Put these on my G&L; S500 electric. Sound great, play great, keeping their tune. None broken yet, but I don't usually break strings. I play at home for pleasure and recording, not out hitting the clubs. Blues, blues slide, rock, metal.I use D'Addario strings a lot. I try others but always come back to them. These will probably be my go to strings on electric guitar from now on. I really like them.
