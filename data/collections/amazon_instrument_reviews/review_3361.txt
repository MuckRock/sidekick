I purchased the On Stage brand microphone stand to use with a theremin, although I may use it at some point for the purpose for which it was designed.  This is a substantial, stable, very solidly built stand.  The base is heavy enough the I can't image that the stand would fall over in normal use.  Should the need arise, it is also easy to disassemble and assemble.  Highly recommended.
