I folds down to a very small size but is quite strong. I have a dreadnaught resting on it now, ready for use. It should work very well with any size acoustic guitar. Sitting by itself, the stand is small enough to be out of the way but is able to hold my precious guitar securely when put to use.  When I get another guitar, I will get another Fender stand to go with it.
