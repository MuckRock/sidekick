I usually use 9s, but decided to try these 10s instead. I didn't notice much of a difference at first, but after a while I noticed that it's easier to tune between the G and D string (3rd and 4th strings) because the gauges are closer. Sound is just right for instrumental rock, shredding metal and delivering that Fatal Blow...
