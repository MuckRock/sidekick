I bought one for my tenor and a different brand for my soprano Ukulele,,  I found I like the snark better for the dollar more in cost..  the other has multi use ( bass, chord, ukulele ) and seemed cheap,  I liked the snark so much I bought this one for my concert ukulele,,  you might ask, Huh  why one for each ukulele,  if you play,, then the answer is simple, for 10 bucks I do not have to hassle swapping tuners out,, and can just grab my ukulele and go.
