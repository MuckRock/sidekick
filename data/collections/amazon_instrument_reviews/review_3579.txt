Wonderful, piano feel, piano action. Will partly sustain if pressed late or let go and reapplied briefly, i didn't even think my keyboard was up to that sort of responsivness (cheapo Yamaha). This is the only pedal you should buy unless you need all three. I am a future M Audio customer from here on.
