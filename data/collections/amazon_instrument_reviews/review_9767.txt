Eh. I wish I had more of a passion to play it, but....ehh. It's not bad if you want a uke, but it's pretty small. I don't know what I was expecting. I don't know shit about ukuleles but I do know get a bigger one if you're not comfortable with small frets. If you wanna be that one fat Hawaiian guy, Israel Kamakawiwo'ole, go for it. but I think he played a little bigger uke than this, lmao.
