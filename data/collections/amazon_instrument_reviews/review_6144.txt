Well like everyone knows this is the copy of the Boss but a lot cheaper than that. It works just fine and i'm happy with it. Anyway if you mean to play at home or in a garage or if you have a band to perform this is a good pedal. If you want more from a pedal the Boss is the one you are going to pick, but overall you should give this a chance.
