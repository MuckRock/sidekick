I don't really care for the FX loop on my Fender Supersonic Head, as I started to get more pedals in my system and really digging all the MXR pedals. so when this came out last year I snatched one up and started experimenting with it. I LOVE it, bypassed I still get that in your face strait into an amp sound, but ingage it with my delays and phase 90's and set the gate to about two o clock and it does a great job of clamping down on the tail end hiss. very cool, and of course it is an MXR so it is built like a tank
