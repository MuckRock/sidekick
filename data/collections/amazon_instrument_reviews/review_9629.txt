These lighter strings are still the best thing for guitar tone since they ran a wire to them. My other review was for the heavier gauge Cobalts but these sound just as good, regardless of P90, strat single coil or humbucker. Great tone, sustain and flexibility. I am sold on any Cobalt gauge - head and shoulders better than any other string on the market and I have tried them all.
