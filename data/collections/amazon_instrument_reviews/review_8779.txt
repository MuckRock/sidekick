I waited a few weeks to get used to the recorder before reviewing it, I didnt want to be like some of the other reviewers who gave a first impression review based of their lack of understanding.It works great for talks lectures and band pratice as well as muic ideas...$12 16GB Sandisc cards work great as long as you understand it only records up to 2gb at a time, but the Tascam will jump to next 2gb if it runs over only causing a few second skip.... it sounds good natural and spacias...get it...I paid $110 shipped for mine, so look on Amazon or Ebay for purchase...the big music stores always mark up the prices very HIGH...zzounds, musicians friend sweetwater music 123, dont buy from them...Jim
