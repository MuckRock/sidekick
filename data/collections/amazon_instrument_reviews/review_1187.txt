This stand seems to be made especially with the Fender Stratocaster in mind and might also be a perfect fit for other Fender guitars.  On my Les Paul the cable plug on the guitar is exactly where the bottom holder bar is.  If I adjust the guitar so the plug is not on the bar, the guitar sits at an angle where the guitar might tip over on it's side.Needless to say I will use this stand for my Stratocaster but I am purchasing a different model for the Les Paul.
