Leather tends to be stiff and not very flexible.  Nylon has incredible strength but isn't very comfortable.  In my humble opinion, cotton twill is totally the way to go.  It's comfortable and adequately strong.  This strap is sturdy and robust, and it's plain black.  You can't go wrong here.Schaller strap locks are compatible with this strap.  You should buy those too, they're great.It gets five stars for being not only better than most other competing products, but also a lot cheaper.
