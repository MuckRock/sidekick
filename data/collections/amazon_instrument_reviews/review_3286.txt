Ernie ball strings are quality strings that last me quite a long time. They sound great, and I have yet to have use set of strings by Ernie that were faulty or disappointing in any way.Of course, I have only used a few other brands of strings, so I don't have an arsenal of wisdom to compare the quality of these strings to. But do take my word when I say that these are extremely reliable, good-sounding, and affordable. 5/5
