There are some more compact units out there (like planet waves), and the intellitouch PT10 is a little clearer to read, but this baby is great for the price. I leave it on my Strat while I play as it can be easily turned on/off as needed and stays relatively hidden behind the head stock. The back lighting is clear enough and the tuner is as accurate as my foot switch tuner. Overall, great deal for the price.
