There's no way to attach the shock mount to it (screws for securing it aren't provided, the holes dont match up, etc...Oh well, I went with a standard microphone tripod behind my computer desk instead.I'll come up with a use for this arm later otherwise I'd have returned it.Will NOT hold a Blue Yeti / Yeti Pro microphone. Just an FYI
