Some say "this capo work bad" I have to ask "are your guitar is good enough to use this capo?" or "are you know how to use capo?"I'm more than 20 years of playing guitar. This capo is worth the price. Good quality and work great for not extream user (Are you nuts?). Best recomended quality and price. PS. May not for very big guitar neck! Enjoy!
