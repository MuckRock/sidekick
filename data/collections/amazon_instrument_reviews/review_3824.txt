These great little accessories are a nice convenience.  The allow a singer to remove the mic from the stand without the normal loud pop from removing it from a wireless clip.  This particular model adds a feature that locks the microphone in the desired position (older models would swivel without much effort).  Bought 6 to replace to older models I had on stage.  They've worked out great: the mics all stay in position when popped on the straight stands, no spinning.  Copasetic.
