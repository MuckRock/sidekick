I needed a solid throne to replace my IKEA computer stool I've been saddled with for the past year. The stool is heavy, easy to assemble, and works as it should. I don't have any long term usage to report but I've seen reviews complaining the stool eventually loosens and will rotate which would be annoying if true. But at this fairly low price point you can't complain about much, and it's better than the real cheap thrones.
