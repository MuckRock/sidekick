This is a very sturdy and well-made bag. Much better for the money than I was expecting. I wish I could find a guitar bag that was this nice! My uke is very cozy inside. The pocket on the outside has a lot of space for your picks, kazoo, ukulele stand, whatever you need to have with you.I carry an iPad around when I play -- the full size iPad doesn't fit in the outer pocket, so I put it on the back of the uke on the inside. An iPad Mini would probably fit.
