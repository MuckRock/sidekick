I bought 2 of these and will order a few more.  They are very nice looking and functional too.  I have been keeping my guitars in floor stands or in their cases but it takes up much needed space and just creates clutter...not that a guitar should EVER be considered clutter.The GREAT thing about these is that your guitar(s) are always &#34;right there&#34; and you can choose whichever one you have a hankering to play at that moment.Just a note of caution though.  Make CERTAIN that you mount the hanger screwed into a stud or on a solid wood surface.  The weight of your guitar will pull it right from sheet rock.  Included are sheet rock plastic backers but personally I would not trust them and nobody wants a hole in their wall.  I would also use longer screws than they provide with the purchase as well.  I'm sure the screws are okay but I wouldn't trust them myself.I would highly recommend these for someone with just one guitar or many.  Well worth the small price paid.  The shipping was incredibly fast too, as always with Amazon.
