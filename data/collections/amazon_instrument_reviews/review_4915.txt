I have a Line 6 Vetta II with a Floorboard that takes care of all my needs for effects (for gigs and in my studio) including a wah pedal but sometimes I take my smaller Marshall down below to jam with friends. I just needed something low-priced that would do the job for me in that situation and I ended up with something a lot more when I bought this pedal. I got it yesterday and have been playing with it for hours now. I really like it and for the price, I don't see how you can beat it. It seems well-made and I think, or I hope, it will hold up well with normal care. I've only ever used my Line 6 Floorboard and before that, an old Crybaby for wah effects before but I'll tell you what I really like about this pedal. It's spring-loaded so it comes back up by itself. It says you can remove the spring too if you want but that feature combined with the fact that it turns on when you step on it and turns off when you step off of it, allows me to be much more creative in my playing and use of the wah. I don't even have to think about whether it's on or off which is liberating and it allows me to use the wah in ways I never could before like on half a riff or certain parts of a passage. I also like that you can really step on it without worrying about switching it off like other wahs. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there's some sort of semi-annoying hiccup in the sound sometimes. It only seems to happen in the last part of the sweep when the pedal is coming up, so I can avoid it if I try. I don't know if it's just mine or is something inherent in this pedal. I'll update this review if I ever figure it out.
