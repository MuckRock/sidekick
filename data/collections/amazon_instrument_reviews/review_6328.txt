I now have two of these (really wish now I had ordered more at the time before the slight price increase -kicks self-) and all I can say - you simply can't beat it.  I also have a Hercules Tri-stand (10x more expensive than this one), and between the two, gotta admit, the only major advantage my tri-stand has is saving space (which actually is a huge consideration for me).  I honestly don't know why other reviewers have had such a hard time with balance as the two Musician's Gear Tubular Guitar Stands I currently own never once have given me an issue (aside from bodily running INTO the thing), and they have held/do hold a variety: Guitars of various styles, Banjos (both open back and BG resonator), Mandolas, anything with a long neck. All in all, unless there is some specialized stand need, I would first come to Musician's Gear.
