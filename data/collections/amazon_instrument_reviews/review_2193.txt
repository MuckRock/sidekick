As a lot of Epiphone owners have learned, cases designed for the Gibson ES-335 clones won't fit Epiphone guitars, as the Epiphones have a slightly larger headstock. This case, however, fits my Dot Custom like a glove. The padding is perfect, the top is arched to precisely fit the guitar, and the build quality is better than you might expect at this price level.
