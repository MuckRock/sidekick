so I never had the luxury of the Grolsch brand strap locks.I tried to raid the water bottles at the local cafe, but alas, I was too slow.It's a bit hard to forge a strap lock out of a Carlsberg bottle cap.So the Fender ones will do just fine, plus they come in 2 colors and say Fender.Time to open another Carlsberg, cheers Fender.
