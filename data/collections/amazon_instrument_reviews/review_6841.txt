I liked these a lot. For the price they work very well, and I am very happy that I bought them. I got a couple of those straight-coupler things, but really their use is quite limited because input jack heights on different effects pedals are rarely the same height so you can't use the straight-couplers. You don't run into that problem with these - they can connect any pedal to any other pedal.
