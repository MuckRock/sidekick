I love the dual bulb design.  The clamp slid around a bit on my music stand.  Overall I like the design and flexibility.  Accidental turn-on in instrument case or gig bag could be a problem.  I'm sure I'll need to find a way to protect the product from breaking since it seems like it would not stand a chance on its own in my gig bag.
