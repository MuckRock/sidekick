I got tired of flying with my guitar everytime I go visit my parents.  Besides the risk to my guitar, there is the cost.  For the price I paid for this guitar, I will be money ahead in two visits to my parents.  I had it shipped to my parents when I bought it, and they are keeping it there for me for my future visits.  It has much better tone than I expected, and very good action.  Stays in tune very well.  I am very happy with my purchase.  Recommending it to my friends who need a second guitar for the beach or the tailgate party.
