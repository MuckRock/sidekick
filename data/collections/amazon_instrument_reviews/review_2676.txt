This pedal is OK, it has all you need in a reverb, the controls are simple and the sound is good, there are other much more expensive units, but this pedal can be compared to those expensive units, the sound is digital clear and the features are basic, it is worth to have one to have fun with, I recommend this product, DigiTech quality is top of the line so you dont have to worry about it, in general a very good unit.
