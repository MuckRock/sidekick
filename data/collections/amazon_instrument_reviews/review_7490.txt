This is the best USB microphone out for under $100 bucks.It's a shame that its been out for a few years now, and there has been no one else to try and make a microphone that has the sound quality of this one.  I love its sensitivity and it adds very little color to the recording.  The sound rejection from the cardioid pattern is very good as I have this fairly close to my computer in my office and I can't hear the computer in my recordings.I haven't used this microphone with instruments, as I am using it primarily for recording voice overs for video, and it sounds great.The only thing you have to do it plug it in, and go.  You need no additional drivers to run this microphone in Windows 7. I did have to restart my machine for my video editing software to see the microphone, but it worked perfectly after that.I just wish that there was an option to skip the stand and just get a shock-mount - YETI combo pack, as I have mounted it on a shock mounted stand attached to my desk and haven't used the base that much since arriving at that setup.If you are in the market for an excellent USB microphone,  look no further, you can't get anything better than this for under $100 bucks.  Just make sure you get a pop filter for it, and Yes the BLUE Pop Filter will work with this microphone despite all of the negative reviews that it doesn't.  Just check out my review video for the Blue Pop.Blue Microphones The Pop Universal Pop Filter
