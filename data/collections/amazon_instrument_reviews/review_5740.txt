If you can read the tiny little screen, this thing records nicely. But it's a pain in the Axx to move from one selection to the other. There were a couple of times I almost threw against the wall. It has a tendency to completely freeze up and the on/off switch does nothing. You have to pull the batteries out and reinstall them for the damn thing to work again.
