As a musician I'm in search of many perfect things including the perfect tuner.  I got the package of two.  Unfortunately, the first one died a quick and sudden death.  A new battery didn't resurrect it.  I couldn't find the other one, because they're small and black.  I finally did find it, and have used it several weeks on my Guild Acoustic, and it works nicely so far. In fact, it works really nice.  If you are concerned about stage appearance, this is virtually invisible to anyone watching or videotaping the gig, a plus because it's pretty small but big enough to read.  At the cheap price, it wasn't worth my time to try returning the first one.  I just decided to eat the loss.  I'm crossing my  fingers hoping this one will last.  If you are playing a really nice, (collectible) guitar, be cautious because these tuners, (and capos too,) can damage the finish permanently. I use a tuner on my Gibson Johnny Smith while I play but always take it off when I'm done playing.
