These strings have a snappier feel and a louder volume (amplified) than regular nickel / steel strings. Cobalt is a different material for making strings and is supposed to have a higher output and a longer life. I recently ordered the new M-Steels from Ernie Ball to try them out as they are supposed to have even more Cobalt for even better output. I use P90 single coils on my Godin LG and these strings sound great. They have a nice feel to them and I can bend the heck out of them. No breaking. No problems with slipping and tuning. I'm hoping the M-Steels will be even better, but if not, these are a vast improvement over the regular strings that I was using, which were Ernie Ball's regular slinky's, made from Nickel.
