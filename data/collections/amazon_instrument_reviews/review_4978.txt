I own two of these Behringer boxes (they come in two modals) and use them with Sonor/cakewalk and an internal software sound modual (Roland Virtual sound Canvas) to play back midi files with my live two piece band. The sound through the PA (Soundcraft mixer and Mackie active speakers) is loud and very clear, in most cases, no eq needed. I guess it really revolves around your personal needs. For live performance these Behringer boxes are excellent and the price is a steal. I do not use it to record as my home recording is done on a stand alone DAW (Tascam 2488 24 track).If you are a live musician or a DJ using something like Virtual DJ these boxes are a great way to eliminate low level hum from a laptop and give you a dramtically better sound than most internal laptop sound cards.
