well Behringer!!!,, have to say that the electronics are german mind,, with all that says ,, go figure it out for yourself,, other then that !!.. plastic so i give 4 stars, cuz of the soft plastic case, and the trouble of changing batteries,, but u can use the charger and u will be well off.. sound is really awesome for the money , and it is high standard delay time and sound,, i don't think u can get the german quality anywhere else for 30 bucks,, i say buy it it is a great delay pedal,, and not only the delay most all Behringer effects are sounding great for the money,, can not go wrong..
