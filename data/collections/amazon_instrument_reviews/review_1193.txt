It holds all my acoustics perfectly.  It's light but stays in place okay.  Rubber pieces are soft enough and seem like they'll last a while.  Two really nice things about this design: 1) it folds up very nicely and becomes pretty small, 2) the all black and slim arms/legs design makes it look nicer in a room.  It pretty much disappears when you put a guitar on it so I'm able to have it out without offending my wife.  :)
