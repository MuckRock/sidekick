This daisy chain worked very well for me - no problems yet. I'm powering about six pedals currently, and I am able to use more than one without any problems or change in sound. I think this is a great way to power some basic effects without breaking the bank, and it should work with any single spot A/C adapter you might already have, so no need to buy another.
