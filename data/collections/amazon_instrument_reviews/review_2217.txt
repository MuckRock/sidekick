I have a Taylor GA4E.  The elixir strings that came with it had nice bass, but were very bright.  I tried some martins, ej16's which I love on my Seagull S6.  However, those strings just didn't have enough bass and too much highs.  I bought these recently and I love them.  They are much better then the original strings.  Very rich bass that really comes out.  The highs are well balanced and still shine through without being too bright.  My one complaint is that the mids sound a bit muddy to me.  Anyway, the best sounding strings with the setup I have.  Now off to buy some different bridge materials.EDIT: 9-22-12I also put these on my Seagull Mini jumbo and wow! Every time I come back to it after several weeks, I forget that I put the 600Ls on it.  Then I pick it up and wonder why it sounds so balanced and nice supporting bass and realize they are John Pearse strings.  Worth every penny.
