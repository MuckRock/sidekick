Perfect OEM.  ONE WORD OF WARNING, if you are not good at soldering and/or you don't have a good iron, don't try this yourself.  The contacts are very thin and will burn up in a hurry.  I recomend readingThe Fender Stratocaster Handbook: How To Buy, Maintain, Set Up, Troubleshoot, and Modify Your Stratif you are unsure.
