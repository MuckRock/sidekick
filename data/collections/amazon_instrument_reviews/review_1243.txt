String changes usually take me 10 to 12 minutes each but I restrung all 3 of my guitars in less than 13 minutes (one is a floating tremolo). The spanner is smooth, the cutter is strangely very clean cutting (usually use electrician wire dykes) and the pin puller is nothing fancy, but does the trick quickly. Awesome little tool and very impressed with it. A++++ on every function, would consider maybe putting a few small rubber inserts on the handle for those sweaty hands, but other than that, it's perfectly perfect. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND
