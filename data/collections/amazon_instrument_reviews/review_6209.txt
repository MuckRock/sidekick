This pedal is awesome. Not only does the DD-7 offer standard dealy and echo it also has reverse delay, modulation, and loop functions. It's capable of looping up to 40 seconds of play which is a wonderful tool for writing two and three part harmonies or working out timing. This pedal is amazing and I highly recomend it for any guitar player. Most of my pedals are Boss because they only build their equipment to industrial strength and standards. This means their stuff is made to last. No flimsy plastics, cheap rubber, or faulty components or parts will cut it in Boss's supieror product line.
