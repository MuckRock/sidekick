It's oil....what more do you want?Turn upside down, squeeze hard, use your &#34;man&#34; level strength and soon the tip will darken, apply liberally to your fret board in a back and forth motion. IMMEDIATELY wipe your fret board clean just to take the wet look away. Let sit for a few hours then dry rest of the way rubbing with cloth.It's okay to soak the wood as long as it's momentary. Don't saturate the fretboard and walk away, wood absorbs oil, too much oil absorbed = fretboard wood becoming swollen and buckling, losing shape and flatness. Not a good situation.Lemon oil isn't like other oils, it isn't very slippery and kind of makes things grabby. It's oil but it actually works more like a solvent, cleaning things and making them sqeaky clean....like your frets...hint hint.Just be sure to buff off all the excess and put a little string lubricant on your frets before you re-string and you'll be a happy camper.
