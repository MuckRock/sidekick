Im not loyal to brands on the whole but when I reach for a pick I hope this is the one I get. They wear out and get nicks so I have to remember to keep ordering them.Edit: Watch the Steve Vai interview where he shares his secret for restoring the edge of worn, nicked, picks. Rapidly,firmly wipe the pick edge against a carpet. The motion is as if you were trying to cut into the carpet with the edge of the pick, repeat 3 or 4 times and whadda u know! The edge is now smooth and nice.
