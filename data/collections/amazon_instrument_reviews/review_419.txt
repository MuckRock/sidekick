... it's a very generic-sounding distortion and is not really useful for much beyond a lead boost into an already distorted amp.  The same is true of many of the pedals from this era, including the (gasp!) Tube Screamer.  The Tube Screamer is a great lead boost into an already distorted amp, but not too many people will tell you that it's a great stand-alone distortion because it's not.  Same goes for the Boss DS-1.  Now, here's where things get interesting:  There are PLENTY of modifications that can be done to this pedal by Keely, Monte Allums, and others, that turn this otherwise mediocre pedal into a raging beast, dripping with tone and gain that sings for weeks.  For the cost of this pedal, and the $30 or so that it costs to get the materials for a mod, are well worth it.  Mine is modified with the Monte Allums Tri-Gain Rectifier modification and it's absolutely killer.  I use it as a lead boost, but by itself it's a nice overdriven tone that you'll find plenty of use for.  If you want a basic, solid, well-built distortion pedal, this is it - but by itself the Boss DS-1 is really nothing special.  But as a platform for great-sounding mods, you can't go wrong.
