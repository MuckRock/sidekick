Oh Man, My Guitars have a new home, love this stand, looks nice and works excellent, currently I have a Strat Style guitar a bass and a Epi Les Paul hanging on this baby, but even with just one guitar it holds up just fine, No unsteadiness, no wiggling, Big space saver, definitely a Good Pick, Great for home use or on the road, it folds up nicely, great padding on heads and body supports, 10 out of 10 on this one.
