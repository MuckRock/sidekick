duriong my lessons, my instructor talked about several models of tuners that a guitarist can get. Some are old time one still with a kick, and the one he recommended was the Snark. Nor the shark, and that is what I thought he said when I first heard it. There were several kinds of tuners and I was looking for a good quality, made of sturdy materials, and was in a good price range. The snark I chose has been working just great for me.
