More likely known as a guitar compensation device, the effect itself it widely used in everything. I have couple few behringer pedals, some complain about plastic housings but a) I don't beat my gear and b) plastic doesn't get rust and corrosion. The build on behringer are tough and fine to me, and the prices make them attainable to all players. The only thing I say negative is all that battery junk inherent to all pedals, gotta spring for power supply plug, if not now, eventually because it'll drive you nuts.Compressor is inherent to quack and pop of chickinpickin and country stuff you just can't not have if that's your thing. The sustainer is just that adds sustain to any guitar regardless of build, so even a cheap one can ring like the best.So you got both in one, tailoring will add life to even a dull axe.  Some put down effects for whatever reason but this one likely adds tones that you can't do without once you find em.
