By recommendation, from the Acoustic tech people, I purchased this for my Acoustic 300B.  Unfortunately it was the Wong switch. BUT&#62;&#62;&#62;It has true FENDER quality.  Well built. Heavy duty construction. The switches are rock solid. This switch can withstand some heavy, quick switch, action.. Rubber, no skid, bottom is a plus. I KEPT the switch because of the quality. I know It will come in handy sooner or later.  .
