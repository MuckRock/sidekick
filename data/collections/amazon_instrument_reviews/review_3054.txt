singing and playing menas you dont get to bend down and pick up that pick you just dropped. I loved this holder, its small enough to fit in your pocket and when you go on stage just throw it on the mic stand. loved it but i forgot it at a gig, thats the down side of it being so small, easy to lose, but it is awesome
