To be honest I'm not metal guitarist but I do love metal music and as far as playing goes I love bluesy solos with lots of distortion. I decided to get this pedal because it was electro harmonix, one of the best names in the business. And for the fact it was cheaper than most. I'm VERY pleased with the pedal and couldn't be happier.
