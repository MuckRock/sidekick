I love this tape for multiple reasons, one because when it's on, it's on and not going to come off with bumps or gigging hard or what not, but at the same time if you would need to reassemble your board and want to move pedals around, you can take it off. It won't be easy, but if you get some leverage on it with a flathead or something you can wedge it off. I was able to get everything off my older board, and it came off so clean I was actually able to sell it! So this is some good stuff! Be prepared to buy a few rolls though for an entire board of pedals, as it hooks to itself so you'll go through it pretty quickly.
