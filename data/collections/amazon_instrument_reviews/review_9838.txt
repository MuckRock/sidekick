Being very disappointing by the sensitivity of the Snark SN 1, I purchased this bargain priced tuner, I could not be more pleased. It has settings for chromatic, bass, guitar, and ukulele. Not only does it have tone dial indicator, but the screen changes color, red for flat, green for just right, yellow for sharp. The screen is also very bright and easy to read. It is very sensitive, no need to constantly move it around like with the Snark SN 1. It is tiny, perfect for carrying in your pocket or purse. I use mine for when I go to the music store and test out ukuleles. This makes a perfect main tuner, or a nice inexpensive backup to more expensive tuners. My main tuner is a Snark SN 8, but this one is just as accurate. The only negatives I can find is that the hinge seems kinda delicate, so you don't want to force it, and the power button is very tiny, but for the size and performance of the unit, those low points are almost irrelevant. Buy a couple, you can get two or three of these for the price of a single Snark or Korg.
