I lost a recording/rehearsal space I shared with some musician friends when it burned down from an electrical fire during 'superstorm' Sandy late last year.  A total loss - and we had no insurance (we sure learned our lesson).So, we rented a new space (this time it's nowhere near the shore) and we are re-building.  We're starting from scratch, and little odds and ends like guitar hangers add up after a while (it's bad enough we had a number of instruments, amps, and other equipment to replace).  So if we can save a few bucks here and there, it helps.I bought one of these hangers to see if they were any good. After I tried it and it worked fine, I went back and bought another 9 of them.  We have guitars, basses, ukeleles and mandolins hanging from them - they work on all sizes.  We use those wide-threaded sheetrock anchors to screw them into the wall.  Like I said, they're nothing fancy, but they get the job done!
