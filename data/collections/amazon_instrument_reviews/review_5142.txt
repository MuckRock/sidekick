I wanted to dismiss the critics and try it out for myself. I wanted to like it, but unfortunately, it just isn't my thing. I played it all but 2 weeks until I got bored and stopped. It now sits on my amp collecting dust. I pick it up occasionally, but I always end up putting it back down shortly after. I am sorry, I just can't dig it... :(Edit: So apparently, a lot of people dislike my review and are insulting me in the comments section of this post. Normally, I'd just laugh at these no-lifers, but I am sick of getting constant e-mails from internet tough guys, so I'd like to formally state  that this is not a bad product. It can be fun, but the effects it gives are not worth $100, and its build quality is not worth $100. Like I said in the original post, I became bored of this item roughly two weeks after purchase and this has not changed. The last time I picked it up was to harvest the battery for the blackout  active pickups on my schecter. Its not that I "didn't know how to use it" like one of the morons in the comments section stated, this product requires very little skill to use. Read the manual if you are having trouble, it explains in great detail the techniques you can utilize with this device.Would I recommend it? If you have a hundred bucks to drop, go for it. If not, your money is best spent elsewhere.
