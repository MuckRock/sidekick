This is a great addition to any stereo system today, assuming you still use your turntable.  Two passes with this brush will clean up any of my records and get them ready for play, free of any annoying pops or clicks.  It won't save a dirty record, you'll have to buy a cleaning solution for that, but this brush will easily take care of dust, hair, and other particles that get attracted to your LPs during regular use.  As another reviewer suggested, I do the first pass with the brush going with the record, as if I was spreading out paint or something like that, and that gets most of the surface particulate free.  The second pass is with the brush going directly against the motion of the record, and this cleans out the dust from inside the grooves of the record.  After that, your record will sound brand new again!There are definitely more comprehensive cleaning and maintenance options, but none that are this easy and this cheap.
