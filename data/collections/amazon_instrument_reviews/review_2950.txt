while learning how to read these things better,, I picked these up,  I need to read better becaseu I have 4 Ukuleles,. all different size and right now my tenor has a wound string on the third string,  so now I am more careful with buying strings, not that a wound is bad, I just suck at playing, my  concert is my favorite and just discovered that it fits in the case I bought for my soprano and I can take it on travel..
