I had intended to carry this, with my keys, attached to my chain wallet. But the wallet hasn't arrived yet so be warned it is a little bit of a pocket space eater. But I suspected it would be before I ordered it so I don't count that against it. Holds 3 medium picks with grip exceptionally tight...almost annoyingly hard to get one out. Will be sure to update if wear & tear has any effect on the grip on the picks. But so far, so great and would consider purchasing this for my musically inclined friends.
