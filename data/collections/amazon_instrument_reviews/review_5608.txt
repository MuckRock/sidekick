Nice features on a pedal this cheap.  I like the capacity to independently control treble and bass.  Switch actually works and makes a marked difference in the pedal.  Not the bulletproof construction of a Boss pedal, but I have quite a few Behringer pedals and I've yet to have a malfunction in more than a year.  I have an EH Big Muff, and this pedal is closer to that than to a Dunlop Fuzz face.  For this price, it's another great tool for your arsenal.  One thing to keep in mind with any pedal that is not true bypass - if you string a bunch of them together, you are going to experience the dreaded 'tone suck'.  If most of your pedals are true bypass or have a high quality buffered bypass, you will be fine.
