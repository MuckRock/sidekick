The connection strap is a great enhancement for my D18 and fits wonderfully. Just one caution...I noticed a couple of scratches on the neck near the Headstock and finally determined that the "Button" was pressing on the neck when in the case.(I have occasion to pack and unpack several times per month)  It's easy to connect and disconnect so that's the "Prevention Mode" I now have in place. Wonderful set-up and I highly recommend it to to ALL Martin Owners!
