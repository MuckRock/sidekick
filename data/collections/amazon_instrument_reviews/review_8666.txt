I have been through a few delay pedals trying to get the sound I want.1) Boss digital delay: I really didn't like the sound of the delay overall. No real positives to mention2) Carbon copy analog delay : Worked great for cleans. But totally muddied up my lead distortion tone (even though it was in my fx loop). I couldn't get the repeats to duck under the main signal3) Nova Delay : I really wanted to like this. Presets, tap tempo and a nice feature set. But the sound just lacked warmth. It was very digital soundingAt this point I wasn't sure what I wanted. Analog delays were warm sounding but too mushy. Digital delays were clear sounding but.. just too digital and uninspiring!I was debating springing an insane amount of money on the strymon timeline, when I found this pedal. Analog dry signal thru with digital delay !! This is what the magic sauce is in my opinion. Now my signal has the nice separation of the digital delay and my underlying tone is preserved. Set it to the 2290 type delay and its perfect. Sure, it doesn't have the presets and what not but for a good sounding delay, this can't be beat at this price range.Sure enough, when I checked the strymon timeline specs, I found out that it too has the analog dry through with digital delay. Just that its delays may be modeled better and it has a rich feature set. But $450+ for a delay pedal is just too much for me.Buy this if you are chasing tone, you won't be disappointed. Skip if looking for presets, tap tempo etc.
