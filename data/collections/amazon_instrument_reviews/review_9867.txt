This is the best octaver I have ever played through (I bought my first one in 1980), and you would be a dope not to get one now before they become expensive. THREE umm... density/timbral/tonal choices [chorused, only octaved signal, 50/50 mix clean-octaved signal] PER setting, which ranges from -2 to +2 octaves. Quiet and tiny footprint. You'd be dumb not to get one while they're cheap.
