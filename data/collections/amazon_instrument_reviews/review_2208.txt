this is one of the best mics in this price range. It sounds incredible, and at this price it's unbeatable. I only use three mics, and this is my main vocal, drum overhead, and acoustic guitar mic (although I use two mics on the guitar). My other mic's are a SM57, which is incredible and not crazy expensive, and an Audio-Technica Instrument/Vocal mic. I love this mic and would replace if it ever breaks.
