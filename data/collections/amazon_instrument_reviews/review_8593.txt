I requested and received one of these as a Christmas gift, then bought another so I could keep the first one at a weekend place where I keep a guitar. It works quickly and easily to swipe on the strings, and keeps strings clean and rust-free (important here in humid Florida) and strings last longer than they did before I started using this even though I've always wiped the strings with a soft cloth after each use.I keep my Slick string cleaner in a quart size ziploc-type bag because it's not airtight when you snap it together and I don't want it to dry out. I hope when it does dry out that I can just add some juice to rejuvenate it. I just don't know what kind of liquid to use. I don't want to drop $8 or so for a new one every time it dries out. Any ideas are welcome, please add a comment to this review if you can help me out.Bottom line, it extends the life of my strings and that's always good.
