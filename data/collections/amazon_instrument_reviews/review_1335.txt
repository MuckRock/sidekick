It beats doing it the old fashion way and the cutter is sweet, but it could be better.1. It slips off if you go too fast, but I thought that was the purpose of using a gadget like this.2. It didn't come with much of any instructions, so I was using it wrong at first. There is a big and a small slot.3. The cutter is so that I pinched my finger during use. The cutter works great, you just have to be careful.4. The screw that holds it on keeps coming loose. Sure I can tighten it, but it just means the design could be better.All and all it's one of those must have gadgets, but it does require a little discipline to master. I hope the next version comes with a soft, rubber insert so it doesn't scratch the chrome off my turner pegs. That and maybe they could use a long screw and some Loctite to keep it from coming loose. And well, maybe they could offer it in more colors to make it easier to find. Everything I have seems to be jet black.
