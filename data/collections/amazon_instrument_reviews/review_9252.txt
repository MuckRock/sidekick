This is supposedly a clone of the MI Audio Crunch Box.  I can not comment on this as I have never played this pedal.  What I can say however with 30 years playing experience is that this is a very good pedal.  When one takes into account the price it is a great pedal.  I own this the classic overdrive and the ultimate overdrive by joyo.  This has the most distortion.  It has a nice ragged edge to it and is great for classic to hard rock.  It does have a bit of noise at high gain but much less than the boss stuff I have had experience with. It is solidly built and apprears road worthy.  great pedal and great value. I would have no hesitation buying this or any other joyo product
