Very inexpensive soundhole pickup with a impressive sound.Very high gain,fits in all size soundholes.Good heavy construction.Of course it's not great.I'm not on stage or anything so works fine for a novice like myself.If you have a Taylor, Martin or Gibson that's not already AE this is not for you & I probably didn't even need to say that!!I just have a cheep Rogue that sounds good with this pickup.It's just a matter of how much you want to (or can) spend.I'm happy with this pickup!!Joe
