I give this product a 5 stars in terms of the idea, but a 4 or less in terms of the materials used to make it, especial the outer plastic shell. The cloth in the sandwitch which does the cleaning is a good and fare material. All and all for the price it's a 5 star. Good idea to clean the strings (especial metal strings) without damaging them or the guitar itself.
