I bought this to tune my 12-string without using the end jack. The headstock is angled back the adjustments that this screen makes have made it easier to see and it is sensitive enough &#8220;feel&#8221; the tone of each string with only minor plucking.  I use it on Chromatic but it includes: Bass, Uke and Guitar too.
