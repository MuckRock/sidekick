Love this strap! It's a good quality strap and I have three of them. Being comfortable and basic you can let your imagine run wild! Just go browse a crafts store and see what you can find to make it YOURS. I can't let on what I've done to mine because...they are originals...but you can have a blast making a one of a kind of your own. Come on, we're artists so show off your creativity.
