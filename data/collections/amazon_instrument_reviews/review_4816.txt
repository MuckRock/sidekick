I have a audio interface that has all the inputs on the back  this was difficult so for the longest time when I had my studio setup I had a mixing board going into the interface. It is always nice to have a channel strip on the line that your capturing because it make the final adjustments fine. This board is great, no sliders which I had to clean. The board has all the same features that were on my 8 channel DOD board that I used for years and it only needs a small space on my desk. The only thing that I am not keen upon is that there is no on/off switch so the unit is unplugged most of the time. It makes the stuff I do in Logic easy. This is a home use unit  great for the price as well as for its quality.
