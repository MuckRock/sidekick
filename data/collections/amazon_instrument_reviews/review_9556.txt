Big disappointment. I've been so impressed by Epiphone's but this one didn't do it. Quality of manufacture and assembly great. Pickups far less than inspiring. Yes, it's a great platform but was so expecting those P90 sound. I may have received the one in a hundred lemons as so many have commented positively on it. Just didn't have the tone and bite I was expecting.I could certainly invest in some PUP's but I have too many great P90 guitars to bother. Roll of the dice I guess.
