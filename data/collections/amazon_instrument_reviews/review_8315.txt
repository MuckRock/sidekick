I buy these and put one in each of my guitar cases. Bright display, easy to use, works well and cheap. I have bought several of their models. I particularly like the fact that when the battery is dying the display becomes darker but the unit still works correctly. I hate the tuners that give you bad readouts with weak batteries. Had a problem with the pivot joint breaking on one of the older models, but it was replaced without a peep by the manufacturer. Newer models seem a bit beefier.
