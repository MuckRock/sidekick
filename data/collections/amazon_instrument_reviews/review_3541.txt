It does what it is suppose to, cut vibration and well I might add. Much better than a standard clip on a mic. This one is not going to break if you take the mic on and off, since it's rubber. If it does break, has a lifetime warranty. Had a Shure SM58 on a table, on a stand in this clip, pounded on the table, only picked up the tap sound my hand has making, and no sub harmonics vibrating though the table. Moved the mic off axis, pounded again, absolutely no noise. Can't ask for more than that.
