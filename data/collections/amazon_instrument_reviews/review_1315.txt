I know that you can easily change strings without paying for a tool to help you out, but honestly this thing is worth every penny. It cuts your changing time down drastically. You don't really know how convenient it is to have the peg puller, winder, and wire cutter all in a little tool until you actually have them all in a little tool. Not to mention, it's very rigid and it certainly seems like it'll hold up for years to come!
