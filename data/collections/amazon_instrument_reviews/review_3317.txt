I've been playing guitar for 25 years and when I was first getting started for what ever reason I hated Super Slinkys with a passion. I was a Fender or D'Addario guy and EB SS were beneath me.Fast forward to a few weeks ago when I got a used Jackson with DEAD stings on it. I wasn't sure I was going to keep it but wanted to give it a chance with new strings. ALL of my guitars are setup with 10s but the Jackson needed 9's and I didn't want to bother setting up the Floyd Rose for 10's on a guitar I might not keep.I came onto Amazon to find some inexpensive Prime eligible strings and these came up, WTH I'll give them a shot.Wow these are some good sounding strings. I have no idea why I didn't like them before, maybe my hearing is much worse than before? Who knows. Anyway I ended up keeping the guitar, a Jackson DK2M.
