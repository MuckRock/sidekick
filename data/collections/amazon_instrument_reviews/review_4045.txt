I really like this strap.  I ended up ordering a total of three with different color schemes so I can have one on each guitar.  They're really comfortable.  They're much less bulky than most of the leather straps I've seen, so I can just keep them on the guitar in the case.I've had the original blue one I bought for about 3 years and it still looks and functions like new.
