D'Addario has always been one of the best string manufacturers around. I've used their strings for electric & acoustic bass, electric and acoustic guitar, Irish bazouki, mandolin, Irish tenor banjo, 5 string banjo & even used their octave mandolin strings on my Serbian brach always with stellar results. When they said these were deluxe premium strings I knew it wouldn't be hype. I was right. I strung my guitar with these about 3 weeks ago & have probably played the guitar 25 or so hours at gigs and in the studio. I've never had a set of strings stay in tune over the course of 3- 45 minute sets but these did. And I was sober so it wasn't just an altered consciousness that made me believe they were still in tune. Not only that they were still completely in tune the next morning when I played it. Of course that wouldn't mean a thing if they didn't feel good on the fingers. They do. Like they were custom made for your guitar. They were on my Rickenbacker so I can't honestly tell you if they work good with a vibrato but I strongly suspect they would. Not only do they stay in tune but 3 weeks later they still sound crisp & new. I'm going to be interest to see how long they continue to sound good.  I usually change my strings every other week when I'm playing regularly so I'm already passed my regular limit. I may update this review in a month or so when I know how long they lasted. Most highly recommended!
