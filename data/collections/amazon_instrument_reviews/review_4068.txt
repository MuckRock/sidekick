Just to confirm several other reviews - these hangers are really nice. They add a nice look to your room and they perform a much-needed function very well. As other have said, though, the drywall mounts are pretty much useless and I DON'T recommend you trust your guitars to them if installed in drywall!Even my lightest guitar was pulling the block away from the wall, so there's no way I'd trust any of my "proper" guitars to these things! I bought some heavy-duty anchors from the local DIY store (you can get them from Amazon tooTOGGLER SNAPTOGGLE BA Toggle Bolt with Bolts, USA Made, For 3/16"-24 Fastener Size (Pack of 10)) and enlarged the hole in the block slightly to accommodate the thicker screw. Much better! I have a few of these, holding up a Les Paul type, a Strat, a Godin and a G&L; tele and they've been holding up (pun intended!) fine for a few weeks now.
