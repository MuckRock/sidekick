I have countless delay pedals and racks. This inexpensive delay is very special. It has the tone and mojo of an analog delay. It won't give you a thousand features but it will get you close to that rich vintage analog delay tone that many of us are looking for. It sounds great clean or dirty. it's a relatively short delay, which is great for many genres. Long delays are generally unusable except for very short passages at the end of a phrase or surreal Eric Johnson like music. I would qualify this as a working musicians delay that can be used in the studio and in a live environment. It's bring an atmosphere of surrealism without going overboard, to your music. Pair it with a nice fuzz or overdrive and you'll be near the dark side of the moon. Many musicians use two delay pedals. I know, I often do. This one is my main delay and my 2nd delay is a very expensive feature rich stereo delay that is a bit sterile and only sees occasional usage. Both work together to help me find the tones that I am searching for. The unit itself seems sturdy and well made. I use carbon zinc batteries in mine. They just seem to sound better to my ears. Keep it unplugged when not in use and it lasts a long time.True bypass and no hiss. Great surprise as I never took Rogue seriously. Never thought it'd be my goto pedal.
