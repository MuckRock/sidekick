I got this Duet2 instead of the single-light version as most Kindle users do.  So far I really like it, cuz it really brightens up the screen and makes it easier to read, even better than day light.  The only trick is to arrange the two lights on the sides of the screen to not having to see the reflection.The AC adapter is a great money saver, as I usually read 5-6 hours at night, and burning up 3 AAA batteries each night is not really a solution :)If you have a Kindle DX, I would strongly recommend this Duet2 instead of the single light version, cuz there's almost twice as much screen to cover.Of course, I also use this on on my music stand beside reading on the Kindle.  It's a versatile light source, and I really like it a lot.
