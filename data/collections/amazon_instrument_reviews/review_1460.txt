All I can say is,,, You should try a set of these Elixir Nanoweb 80/20 Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings for yourself. You will not want to go back to any other set of strings. I've been using Elixir strings for many years. They have better feel, sound, and last longer than all other brands I've used playing Guitar. Elixir has excellent quality control too. I've never had a problem.
