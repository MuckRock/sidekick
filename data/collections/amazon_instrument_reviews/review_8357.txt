The design of this product is innovative and excellent.  I haven't used it for as long as I would generally like before writing Amazon reviews of purchased items, and so cannot testify to its reliability, but suffice to say that, for the price, it would be hard to beat.The display is very clear, and the ability to clip to your headstock while tuning is marvelous.  I wonder how I ever lived without it before.For live gigs playing electric, I would prefer a floor tuner running through a pedal board with a patch cable, as noisy environments probably wouldn't be ideal for this tuner.  This is more for your parlor acoustic setup.
