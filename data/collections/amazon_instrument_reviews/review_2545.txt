At first I thought this would be a gimmick, but it was cheap so I figured what the hell. Once I had it, however, I realized how invaluable it was. When performing live, I always had to make sure to stand the exact same distance away from the mic of the volume would change based on my distance from the mic. Once I got this little guy though, I just sing right into it and even press my mouth up against it at times. Volume remains constant, white noise is gone and the sound is crystal clear. It also protected my mic in a fall once too. Can find anything better for this cheap.
