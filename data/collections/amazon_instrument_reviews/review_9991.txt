I'm always looking for the perfect electric guitar strings, as is evidenced by my drawer full of spare string sets that I felt failed me for one reason or another. A set of these came my way & as I had just gotten a 1966 Fender Jaguar I did what I always do when I get a new guitar - I restring it even though the strings were practically new. I could immediatly tell the difference in both feel & sound. The sound was crisper than the super slinkys that were on it & they felt good to my fingers. The only reason I took them off was because the Jag was for surf music & I wanted heavier gauge so I put these on my Tele, which was a match made in heaven. They sounded great but most telling is that after a month or so of heavy usage they still sound great. Reasonable price, great sound & long lasting. To me thats a perfect combo. Highly recommended!!!
