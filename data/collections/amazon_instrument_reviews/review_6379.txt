These are great,  have 3 of them now. I use them when I play with my duet and sometimes with the band. Used to plug in, but the batteries last a good while so I rarely use the cord anymore (there are enough cords in my life). I use a 3 ring binder with lyrics and fake chords, these light up everything pretty well. Only complaint - the clip isn't the best, but it's never fallen off or anything like that. Will but another one if any of them die, great product.
