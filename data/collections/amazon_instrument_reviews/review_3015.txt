I bought this strap for a ESP EC-1000 Les Paul style guitar.  I was a little apprehensive before ordering considering the cheap price. When I got the strap I was impressed. The locks work perfectly and fits my guitar. The back of the buckles are covered with foam so that they don't harm the finish on your guitar. Locks are solid and ratchet closed with a release button to open. It's not going to unlock on you. Strap would be more comfortable with a shoulder pad as the strap is nylon with no padding. Good strap for sitting down or playing standing short gigs with a light guitar. Long shows with a heavy axe might not be too comfortable.
