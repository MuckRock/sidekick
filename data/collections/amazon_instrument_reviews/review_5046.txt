When I sit down to practice my guitar, I just want something very simple to keep time. It was a pain previously to have to mess with menus and such on a computer to bring up a metronome app from tablet, phone or computer. With this, I'll just have to flip a switch and dial the tempo that I want. Simple and loud enough for me to practice my guitar routines. I do recommend this one.
