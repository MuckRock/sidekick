I am using it to record my garage band's demo to get us more gigs. I have been a gigging musician for over 20 years. Had it a few days and with in a half hour after opening it, I had two guitar tracks, a bass track, and drums tracks (from garageband) all laid down. Easy to plug in, I am using it with a MacBookPro and garageband. Very quality recordings so far. Like it so far.Edit- Put down some vocals with a cheap shure mic (pg-48) used fx from garageband and got a nice vocal track, easy to layer over harmonies. Still have yet to mic up a drum kit...Still enjoying the product, still amazed at the ease of use. Did try to install software on a PC with Vista, no luck.Edit - Mic'd up a drum kit into a mixer, lined it out to this interface, I then mixed the drum mics with the mixer. You can record the drums as a single track so once they're recorded you can not mix them individually (ie. snare, kick and so on). I do get very quality recordings with it set up this way. I am sure a recording engineer could give me better ideas on how to get more out of it, but as for now, I am very pleased.
