I bought these to fit my two microphones - they snuggly hold Shure SM57 and SM58.  However, my two mics came with Shure clips (to my surprise).  These clips are 1/16 in. from front to back.  In comparison, the Shure clips are 1/4 in. to 1/8 in. from front to back.  So, the Shure clips are more sturdily built, but both seem to hold the mics well.
