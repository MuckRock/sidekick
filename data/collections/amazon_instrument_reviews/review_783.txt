I've been a huge fan of dunlop picks for a long time. I started playing 15 years ago, and used the slim, floppy picks for a long time. As time went on and my guitar skills grew, I needed a pick that was sturdy, and wouldn't flex to play more intricate and detailed songs.The tortex purples are my favorite, and they're the thickest ones I can find. I like the soft sandy feel of these. They don't slip out of your hand easily, and because they're so thick, they take a long time to wear out.
