These D'Addario "EXP16 Phosphor Bronze Light" strings for acoustic guitars produce decent sound and are designed to last longer than "normal" strings. We have two beginner guitar players in the house and we are very hard on strings, so these are a good choice for us.We are very pleased with the way they sound, feel, and last, so will likely pick up these again the next time we need to replace the strings.Recommended!CFH
