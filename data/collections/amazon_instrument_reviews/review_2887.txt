Anyone who plays a lot know that strings are very much a personal thing.  The tonal qualities, weight, feel, materials and all other qualities / variables combine to make strings your very own personal favorite.  For me these strings bring it all together and are my string of choice for all 12 acoustic electrics I use to play what I consider rock ballads using my strumming-style of play.I love the feel and tone of these strings for my style of play and my equipment set-up.  I do have some issues with these strings, but overall, I'm willing to put up with the issues for the overall performance I get from the EJ26 strings.  The issues include what I think may be premature breakage.  I do not play &#34;hard&#34;, I play long (playing several hours daily), but I play rock ballads using a somewhat softer strumming style.  (I definitely do not &#34;pound&#34; on the strings - I like to think of it as fairly &#34;gentle&#34; strumming.)  Yet, I seem to manage to break the high E & B strings on a regular basis (by playing, not by over tuning).  Some of this can be expected, but what bothers me is the frequency with which I'm breaking G strings.  I simply don't think these wound G's should be breaking at all with my style of playing.  I've noticed that the current &#34;most helpful critical review&#34; mentions this same problem.  I change strings frequently so I don't think this is the reason they are breaking.Overall, I am willing to put-up with what I believe to be some premature breakage (especially with the G string), for the other qualities that draw me to the EJ26 strings.  They sound great for my style of play, equipment, and set-up.  They feel great.  I love 'em and will continue to buy quantities of them for my 12 acoustic electrics.  I just wish I had a better feeling about the premature breakage.
