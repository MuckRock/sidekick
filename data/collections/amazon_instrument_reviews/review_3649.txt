I really like this guitar stand, it was worth the extra money. It securely holds my acoustic guitar and leans back a bit so you can clearly see it. Very stable base. The bottom which holds the guitar can be switched over for different size bases of guitars. A good price, a good buy. Glad I invested in it. By the way, I read several reviews which said this had a "smell" to it...Mine does not. I just wonder what other people have encountered?
