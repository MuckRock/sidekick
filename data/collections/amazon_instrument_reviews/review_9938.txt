If you're going to use this as an insert effect into any amp, the first thing you need to do is turn off the amp model.Although I liked the presets in the MS50G, none of them worked in my rig. The first thing that I did when I brought it home was to make a different single patch for each effect. The big question is &#34;Why?&#34; especially since it's designed to handle up to 6 effects simultaneously. The answer is... I like my overdrive, distortion, and compressor, but I couldn't make up my mind on delays, choruses, flangers, fuzz... and it's always nice to have options for additional over drives and distortions.This is the 4th pedal on my board sitting behind a ModTone Lemon Squeeze Compressor, TC Electronics MOJOMOJO overdrive, and a Wampler Sovereign distortion.I give it 5 stars because it accepts pedals well and it serves so many different needs. Normally, I have it set as just a chorus pedal, but occasionally I use it as an additional overdrive or distortion. It's great to be able to plug in whatever I need and know that the sound quality is going to be great!It takes a moment to level match each patch so the transition is smooth, and at some point I may take the few remaining slots and make them combinations, but as of yet, I really haven't had the need... a great utility pedal and a must if you're just getting started on your pedal board and you're not sure of what pedal you want where. This will help you figure things out... and if you're not careful, it may find a permanent home!
