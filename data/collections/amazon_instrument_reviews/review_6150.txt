great little pedal. Has a nice set of adjustments to give a wide range of delays and echo to your sound. Easy to use, very low price, classic sounds. I wish I had 4 ears so I could buy another one. Strictly home studio use, haven't tried gigging with it, though it seems pretty sturdy, it is plastic, but pretty solid plastic. I also have a Danelectro  Fab Echo and this just blows it away. The Danelectro is okay, but it just doesn't have the depth or adjustment that the Berhinger pedal has.
