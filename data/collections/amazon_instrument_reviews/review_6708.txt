The picks we received were "Legacy" and not "Alice" brand. While not as pictured, these are good enough for us as we (my daughert, son, and me) learn to play guitars. The mix of different thicknesses was fairly even, so we were able to select the one that felt "right" for each of us.The pearliod looks good and overall am happy with these picks.CFH
