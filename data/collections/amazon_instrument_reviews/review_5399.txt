I am a pro drummer and run pro sound support PA systems for outside venues as well from time to time. It is essential that I have cables that carry the great sound we make out to the speakers to reproduce it acurately to the crowds. These 50 ft xlr cables are made well, I hear virtually no sound loss or distortion over the long lengths. And as usual dealing with GLS and Orange County, they came fast packed well and safe. I am a continuing returning customer because of quality, price and service. And though on this particular order I had no need to contact them, they checked in with me to make sure everything went well. Great folks to deal with.
