After researching overdrive pedals for what seemed like forever, I chose the Fulltone OCD. The reviews on Amazon helped as well, along with Youtube demos and guitar mags. What finally made my choice for me was when I found out that Robin Trower used one for his last 2 U.S. tours befor Fulltone made him a sig model.Okay, this pedal is very versatile for an overdrive. The HP/LP switch alone gives you a very distinct tone for solos or rhythm, and tweaking the dials adds to the fun (I'm constantly playing with the tones; a minor adjustment makes a huge difference). The coolest thing is that this pedal is responsive to your playing dynamics; picking softly dials down the OD, then you can just unleash the crunch with harder attacks...much better than trying to roll-off the volume. The true-bypass is great, as you lose no original signal when not engaged. As of now, this is my favorite piece of gear.If you're looking for massive distortion, keep looking. But this will be my 'go to' blues/rock pedal for quite some time.
