these strings are different and really quite nice.  the high strings are thinner and thus much easier to play and bend.  the lower strings retain the depth and sound of my usual strings.  I really like them.  only possible difficulty is that high E etc might tend to break a little quicker due to being a thinner string.  I have a bunch of these on hand for my  strat and my Epiphone as well the standard Earnie Balls
