a well built pedal of good quality, with enough weight to keep the body stable, and a good &#34;middle of the travel&#34; execution point for sustain.  With the correct keyboard, the pedal will also allow for half pedaling.**very important to someone who has keyboards from multiple manufacturers, especially older models; this pedal does has a switch to allow for polarity adjustment (for most newer keyboards this doesn't matter, as polarity can be edited globally, or, alternatively, polarity is sensed on startup so long as the pedal is plugged in)  Some other pedals, particularly those from name manufacturers, will only work with some keyboards.  That said, I feel this M-audio compares favorably to it's most visible competition, Yamaha's FC4 offering.  The Yamaha pedal is a bit heavier, which I do like and subjectively implies better quality, but, in reality, the Yamaha did not last under the same circumstances, breaking down and needing a spot repair after a year on the road.  Last,  the Yamaha FC4 does not have the half pedaling option or polarity switch, making this M-audio pedal a great all around option.In my case, this pedal has been on the live stage, unpacked and packed, tossed around a fair bit, for 2 1/2 years with no problems.
