Mine came flattened in a little box.  I wasn't happy that its form was deformed.  Well in a few days it popped back into shape so I didn't have to ship it back.  A good sign!I am using it for both some music and computer stuff.  The bag is well made considering its price.  You cannot even get a backpack for this price.  I love its depth.  A number of these types of bags are too shallow so the zipper is about to burst once loaded.  This is a solid 4"+ depth and cozy padding around it for protection.  Be sure to check out all the dimensions though.  Its very long - I was a bit surprised but that was me misreading it.  I think I saw "micro" and thought shorter.Not only is this a great music tote but also a decent computer / electronic or other tool tote for equipment that is wider than a brief bag or backpack.  I'm thinking of getting another because of this.The only minus is that I wish the outside pocket was a little larger and maybe had an inside pocket or folder / paper slot.  But these are just wish list items.  Finding padded bags this size is a pain so if you need this your options are limited.  Lucky this is a good option.
