I'd been shopping for a music stand at local music stores, all of them at the cheapest price for this type with a solid backside are $45 plus tax. This item including shipping cost me only about $23 here from Amazon, and the seller Musician's Friend sent it promptly, got it within 10 business days without any problems. I had no trouble putting the stand together without any instructions. The bolts aren't as easy to adjust compared perhaps to a more expensive stand, but I don't care about that. It's not hard to adjust, and most of the time I have it at a certain height, so no need to fiddle with it, but during a group performance, it did need to be adjusted for different people and that was ok but could be smoother. If you're someone who needs to fiddle with the stand height constantly you might want to get a higher priced one that makes that easier, but if you are only occasionally going to adjust the height, it's no big deal. Other than that, it is a solid and handy stand that meets expectations and does what it should, for 1/2 price off retail. Excellent. I'm completely satisfied with this.
