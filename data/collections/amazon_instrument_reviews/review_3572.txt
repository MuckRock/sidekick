This pedal is outstanding for the price.  The feel is great and it doesn't move at all when you put it down on the floor.  The only thing I disliked was that it doesn't support "half dampening" like most of the higher end pedals around this price range.I got this for Christmas of 2007 and it is still going strong used every day in my recording studio.Great product
