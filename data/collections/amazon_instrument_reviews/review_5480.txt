I personally think this Seagull is over rated. A lot of reviewers are covering the muddy (not crisp) sound as &#34;mellow&#34;I don't think so.  I have over 115 guitars in my collection, and around 15 of them are acoustics.I have nothing against Seagull, or Canada, but bought one of these NEW off the rave reviews, and just recently (I have had both theS6 and FGX730 for five years) pulled the S6 out for another try just because I could not make myself believe it sounded worse thanmy used Yamaha; IT DID!Side by side I went through the chords on each guitar, and had to finally come to the conclusion that the Seagull had to go.With a price tag of $420.00 for the S6, and $282.00 for it's Yamaha equal, the FG730S, unless you just feel like throwing yourmoney away, I would stay away from this guitar, and look elsewhere.Oh, by the way, I have an S6 for sale!
