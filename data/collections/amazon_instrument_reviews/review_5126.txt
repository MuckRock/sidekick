Received promptly and tested out with acoustic/electric guitar. The sound is much better than expected and the volume is loud enough for small room performances. The treble needs a little boost but with the three channel adjustments it can be made to sound fine. The small amp is just what I was looking for and the second channel for a mike is a big bonus, I haven't tried it yet since I can only play one instrument at a time but with an adapter for a 1/4 inch RCA plug it could also be used to amplify two instruments at the same time.
