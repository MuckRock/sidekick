Granted, I'm no expert on what's out there in the world for guitar cleaning materials. This is my first foray into that world.But, I've used it, and it's easy. The polish is great, the cloths are soft and just what they should be; the wax is wonderfully shiny and easy to put on and buff. Everything here is, as far as I can tell, just as advertised - a way to keep one's instruments in good shape.I now have a shine on my guitar that is better than when it arrived from the factory, and there doesn't seem to be any chemicals in the stuff that corrodes or otherwise destroys the guitar, like perhaps some fly-by-night cheapy cheapy product maker might offer.Maybe there are better polishes and waxes out there - and knowing the way the world works, I'm sure there are some, probably made out of rare elephant glandular excretions that sell for $500 a bottle that the pros use and maybe would be worth 6 or 7 stars on the Amazon review. I don't know. But come on; this stuff is just fine.
