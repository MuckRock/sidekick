I've had this Amp for 5 years and it still works and looks great. Took a while for me to learn all the things that the Jam can do since I was new to the world of electric guitars and amps when I received it. Crank this baby up and it moves air. I've used all the in's and out's with no problems. My rig consists of an Ibanez AS73, Schecter Devil Custom 2008, Line 6 HD500, and an AKG Perception 420 thru a Line 6 UX2. Finally, I only play at home so this gear doesn't get banged up from gigging.I agree here> (As B. Russell said: The only downside I can mention is that this amp may not be for the technically challenged. There are a lot of features on this amp, but you need to learn how to use them. The common features are easy to use, but if you want to dig in and start really taking advantage of the amp, you will need to invest some time into it. Since I'm not scared of playing around in menus and reading the manual, this amp fits me well.)
