I am totally satisfied with the stand.  I had some misgivings after reading some negative reviews on Amazon but this stand serves me well.  The misgivings I had was with the extra weight I intended to place on it with my tablet stand equipment and the Samsung tablet.  However, I am very happy to report that it handles the extra weight very well and does topple over even when the boom is extended with the mic and space needed for the tablet and guitar playing.  I easily reommend this Item.
