First, keys are not my best instrument to play, just a beginner, I'm a professional guitarist. That said, I purchased this for my home recording studio. The controller that I had was a ION but had mini keys. I love the fact that this controller has full size keys. Works great with my Mac Book Pro and Logic Pro X. I know it's not the best controller but it's good if your on a limited budget.
