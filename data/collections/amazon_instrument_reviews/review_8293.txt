I'll just say, newbie to ukulele, no idea how to tune it, instructions online say GCEA, I put this on the head, plucked each string, tuned the machine head until it said dead on, and that was it.  I keep this clipped to my ukulele standInstrument Stand for Violin, Ukulele and Other Small Instruments(see my reviews of it, it's so so, the stand), and just turn it on and tune the uke before I take it off the stand.  ONly time will tell how these little nickel watch battery style battery lasts, I find them a bear to buy, but time will tell.  Anyhow, I concur with the reviews on here, glad I listened to them, and for any brand new ukulele players out there, this is the one to get.  C ya
