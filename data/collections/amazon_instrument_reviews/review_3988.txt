I needed a new bass strap because my old one was frying at the ends. I choose this one because it was very durable. The nylon is very strong, I do not see it fraying in the future. The leather eds are nice and thick so the hook wont slip off the strap pegs. The guitar pick pocket on the the leather ends is a nice addition to keep your picks at hand. Good colour selection too. Highly recommended!
