Will hold any guitar that I've seen. It holds the guitar on the wall safely without having to worry about it falling. It's also very easy to install. It's a great price; and it's definitely worth the investment. Not only do you not have to have your guitars on the ground, but you save space putting them on the walls, and not only that, but it make any room look even better.
