Got the 3 pack and oh what a great difference on me, my guitar, and my sound.I'm a 62 YO newby to guitar!! This proves that easy helps. I have a big baby Taylor and when i needed new strings I went to the wrong place, got Martins installed -- wow did they make a (bad)diference to me.  Sounded like a 1950s monoral record and were really very uncomfortable to play. My friend said that he uses D'Addario and that they make ALL the difference in the world!! Tried them and he was right.  I changed my own (on the big Baby) and the color coding made it really simple to put the right string in the right position (instead of switching the E and B string like the dealer did!) MY Taylor recommends Elixr, but the D'Addarios seem to play with a nicer tone on the Taylor and just as important are easier on the fingers!!
