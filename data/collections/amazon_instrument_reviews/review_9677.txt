I used it once, will only use it when I'm in front of it, so that, no one takes it, it works great when you're using your tablet and I use it for playing Pandora when playing in clubs, It not Djing it's DJ sound without the DJ, no offends DJ your job isn't easy, but when their isn't a DJ this helps. Remember to have Wifi in order to connect to Panadora.
