I've had string winders for years, but never a multifunction one like this. I recently bought it for my niece, and taught her how to change her strings.The different size gaps make it 'grab' the tuning pegs much better than my old one. I was able to use it on an electric, steel string acoustic, and classical, and it grabbed them all rather well. The string cutter works well, and the peg puller does also. So handy!
