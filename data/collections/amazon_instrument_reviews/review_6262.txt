This stand easily supports my 50 poundFender Frontman 212R 100-Watt 2x12-Inch Guitar Combo Ampat any height setting. In fact, even extended to the highest the this stand supports that amp with no issues from the center of gravity or weight distribution of the amplifier.I love the ease of setting up and breaking down this stand. It is essentially three parts: the base and two removable arms. Granted that this is heavy, but the added weight is there because this thing is built like a tank.In addition to being rock solid, the parts mate perfectly with no slop in tolerances. The support arms slide into the base with no friction or excess movement, and the height adjustment has three nicely spaced positions. You merely pull back on the spring loaded knobs to release the safety pins that engage the arms for position. Once you line up the holes, release the knobs and the pins solidly engage and hold the amp in place.My only complaint - and it is more of a wish - is the tilt of the stand is at a fixed angle. I would love it if I could adjust that too, but I am sure that it would drive up the price of the stand. One final note: these significantly increase the footprint of an amp on stage. Specifically, it increases the depth dimension by nearly 100% of my Frontman 212R, although the difference in length is nominal. I mention this so you can factor that in if you normally play small venues with cramped stages.Overall, this is an excellent stand and one that is stable and heavy-duty. At the current price (at the time of this review) it's a bargain.
