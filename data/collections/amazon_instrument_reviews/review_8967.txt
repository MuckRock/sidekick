To start off with the unit is all metal construction and built like a tank, it is very easy to set up and use the controls are self-explanatory.You can get a wide variety of coarse effects from this unit from the very subtle to the crazy overdriven David Gilmour sound.One distinct feature this pedal has that sets it apart from the rest is you can actually use base and trouble cut off controls to tailor the sound to make it sound less tinny  and more full.Overall for the money this is a fantastic value well-built and has outstanding sound get it you won't be disappointed!
