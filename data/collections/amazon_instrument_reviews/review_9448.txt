For the price and the fast shipment (despite a notice that said it would take 2 months to ship) it is well worth the money. Does what it's supposed to do so far. I can imagine that a lot of use may eventually wear out it's springiness but for now it is working great for my needs. I don't capo too much, just getting into learning some new songs that require it so cheap was the way to go for me. I could see someone who capo's a lot might want to look elsewhere but if you're only needing something simple and cheap, look no further.
