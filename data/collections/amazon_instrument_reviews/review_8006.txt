Item is as described. You receive 3 felt picks, plus a bonus ant hill music pick. (mine was purple) Picks were defect free, but the bonus pick was noticeably dusty from the felt picks, which a clean moist cloth will easily fix. But because the picks were a bit dusty it could transfer to your instrument. None the less the picks make my uke sound louder but you may be hearing the pick a little bit. But over time this starts to disappear. The picks are pretty comfy to hold.
