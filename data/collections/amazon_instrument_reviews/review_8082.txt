Do not let the size of this little amp fool you.  I have used Roland and Fender amps and PA's.  I heard a buddy preforming with this with a drummer and bass and went and bought it the next day.  I use it for my small solo gigs.  But it will cover a good size room also.  Great vocal and guitar sounds.  I can't believe what can come out of a six and half inch speaker now a days.  JUST AMAZING.  I have cut the amount of equipment considerably that I need to do a gig anymore. It wont break the bank and it wont break your back.
