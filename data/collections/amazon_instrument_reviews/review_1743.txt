I love this guitar strap button. It's a great alternative to the invasive buttons that have to be screwed in. I actually purchased it for my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pink. It works well for it's stated purpose and appears to be of high quality. The leather is nice and soft and the button fits snuggly into the leather hole. Check out my user name stinkylungs on Youtube to see a video I made of me installing it on my new uke if you want to see it up close.
