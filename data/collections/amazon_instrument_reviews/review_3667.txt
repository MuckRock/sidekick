I purchased this for my son's acoustic guitar.  I was tired of finding it not in its case and lying on the floor, or against his dresser.  Since he got this stand, his guitar has been put away on it every time.  The security strap is a nice feature, to make sure the guitar doesn't get knocked off the stand.  Great value for the money!
