I've probably used every type of pick out there at this point in my life, and find that Planet Waves makes a good one at a fair price. Picks will always be a subjective thing, every user has his/her own preference, so trying out as many as you can can benefit you in the end. These are well made, last quite awhile, and they don't even look bad, try them out, you might just like them :-)
