If your a musician (or want to be?) recording you practices and rehearsals are an important part of your ability to learn to play well. I have found recording to be extremely important to my ability to learn new songs and that having been said, you cannot beat a Tascam recorder for ease of operation, features and sound quality. Enough said, buy a Tascam if you serious about your music.
