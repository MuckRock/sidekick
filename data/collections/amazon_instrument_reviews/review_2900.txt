I recently acquired a Guild six string that I strung with my usual EJ16 strings, however, it just wasn't playing or sounding as good as I knew it could.  After tweaking the action and restringing with EJ17 Mediums, that Guild has sounds great with plenty of punch & power to spare.Overall, I rely on D'Addario strings for all my instruments. What's not to love about a 300+ year-old, family-owned company that (beginning with the days of catgut) has been responsible for dozens of string making innovations?  Beyond great tone & playability, these suckers are reliable as all get-out. These days if a string breaks, I know right away I need to check the nut & saddle, because these strings don't snap unless something on the instrument caused damage. In fact, I used to snap strings every other performance before I learned to properly hone the string rests on my instrument and use NOTHING but D'Addario strings. I haven't broken a string during a performance in years, and believe me, I ain't being gentle with 'em.
