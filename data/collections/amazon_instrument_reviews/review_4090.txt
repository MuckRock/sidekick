When this product appeared to be defective I contacted the seller. While they agreed to an exchange they did say that I was liable for up to 5.81 in shipping costs. I thought that more than 25% of the item's cost was a bit much.I decided to conatct the ON STAGE people directly. Not only did they seem genuinely cocerned about their product living up to their standadrs they patiently and politely guided me through the proper set-up, determined that the item was defective and then pronmised me a replacement without having to return the defective item, a microphone boom. I had the replacemnt in about four days.I have been using ON STAGE instrument and microphone stands for several years now. They are extremely well manufactured, they look great and are sturdy as heck. And I am extremely greatful to the compnay for the way they handled my issue.I have rarely been so satisfied with the way an issue was resolved and at the same extremely satisfied with the product as well.On Stage Stands 7701B Tripod Boom Microphone StandSquier by Fender Affinity Telecaster, Butterscotch BlondeShure SE115-CL Sound Isolating Earphones (Clear)Mini 3.5mm Flexible Microphone for PC/Laptop/Skype
