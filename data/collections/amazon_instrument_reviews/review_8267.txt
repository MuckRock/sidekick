I wasn't expecting much as the price was very reasonable for a good tuner. I have to say it is one good (funny looking)clip on tuner. Many useful functions. I especially like the fact you can check intonation without changing anything. Like the capo and metronome feature. I just really like this little guy. Good job Snark.
