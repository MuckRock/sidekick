If you need a tube screamer. You can't go wrong with the TS9. The only reason why you shouldn't get it, is if it isn't the right tone for you. I say this because you can't say anything bad about this pedal. It sounds amazing. It just might not be your sound. I personally went with the TS808 because it compliments my amp better than the TS9. People who say this is better than the TS808 or vice versa are choosing the wrong wording. They prefer it. It's not better. Both are great.
