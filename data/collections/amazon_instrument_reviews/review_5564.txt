WOW, I got more than I expected from this Chromatic Tuner, Sure it's a plastic case, but who would be rough on a pedal anyways, had it about 3 weeks now, and im impressed, I see people say the blue indicator light is too bright, but truthfully, its OK, because the tuner lights are plenty bright enough, if it is too bright for you, just put a little piece of black tape over the light, but like i said its OK cause you can still see the tuner lights, I use this pedal with theVisual Sound One Spot Combo Pack, works like a charm.
