I got the aged white. I was changing out pups for a more vintage sound. This kit was cheaper to buy then all the parts one by one. I have a MIM 2012 Strat, every thing went together with out any issues. Best price online and the shipping was super fast. I back plate is the mint green, but looks awesome on the guitar.
