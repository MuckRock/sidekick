First, I love these picks and used them exclusively for years.  I have dozens of them, they never wear out.  I used to use them when playing in a loud rock band, and never had any issues.  They are very comfortable, and easy to control.Now the bad: the sound.  Not the sound of the plucked not itself, but the hard plastic of the pick against the string makes a very noticeable "plinking" sound that is audible through your amp.  If all you're playing is loud music, this may not be an issue.  But I essentially stopped using them when I started playing in a different band with more dynamics, because during quieter passages the plinking sound of the pick on the strings is VERY noticeable to me.So, too bad.  I think these are great picks, but I'd like them to be made of a softer material.
