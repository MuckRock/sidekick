I like using these strap ties far more than I do tying a strap to the neck.  They are a great idea.  I found the button on the strap somewhat difficult to install the strap, but eventually got it on.  I have two of these, and I use them.  I'd definitely recommend them to anyone who doesn't like tying on their guitar straps.
