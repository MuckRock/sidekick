I bought this adapter to power several devices by different manufacturers. Thus far, I am very pleased. Some of my guitar effects require at least 320 milliamps, which this adapter handles with no problems. I have heard no hum or noise from the adapter, either. It does its job reliably and well. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
