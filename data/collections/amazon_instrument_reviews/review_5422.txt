I have 2 of these combo packs and they are simply great! I have 15 pedals connected to these 2 Visual Sound 1 Spot units on my Pedaltrain Pro, and have all the wiring underneath. Looks pretty neat along with the George L's cables that are almost invisible. The 1 Spot works wonderfully and generates no noise, hiss or buzz. Connects and powers great. No need for something fancy to effectively power up to 8 of 9V pedals with one combo pack. The adaptors work great with other than the regular AC connections like those found on MXR or Boss pedals. Highly recommended.
