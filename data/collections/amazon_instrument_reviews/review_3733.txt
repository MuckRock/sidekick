I was worried about dropping my guitar on my foot, or the floor. The strap wouldn't hold my guitar any longer. I wanted something cheap, something that don't require to remove the buttons by unscrewing it, I was worried about damaging my guitar. So I decided to get this strap lock, it rocks and it works perfectly.
