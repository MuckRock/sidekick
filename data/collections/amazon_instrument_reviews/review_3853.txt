The Eminence Patriot Cannabis Rex is probably the smoothest sounding guitar speaker I've ever heard.  Period.This does not mean that it's dull sounding or muffled at least, not if you hearing is still good.  I hesitated quite a bit before I decided to buy it and install it in my Fender Mustang II but my worries were for naught. Incredibly, it tamed the icepick highs without losing the shimmer and clarity of my clean sounds.  Yet, for overdrive sounds, there is very little fuzziness - just a big full and FAT sound that's articulate without being buzzy.  If you play metal you'll probably hate this speaker but if you like bluesy, classic rock and jazzy sounds, this is a speaker to seriously consider.  I turned my Mustang II into an open back combo and the Cannabis Rex gave the amp the low end extension that it needed.  I had to turn the treble control up a bit more but unlike most amps, it never got shrill or piercing, just buttery smooth and clear. It's also much more efficient than the stock speaker at 102db@1W/1M.I don't know how Eminence did it but I love it!
