I get a lot of grease on my guitar from lotion, sweat, fingerprints, dust, what have you; I take some of this, spray it on a cloth, give it some elbow grease, and my guitars are shiny as the day it was made. I use it on my acoustic and electric guitars. The bottle lasts pretty long cause the mist is pretty fine. I use two sprays on the cloth for the front side of the guitar and then repeat for the back. It has a fresh lemon scent. I recommend this to everyone, a lot of product for an affordable price.
