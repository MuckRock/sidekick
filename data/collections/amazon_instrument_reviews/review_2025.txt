With all the other great reviews noted here, I decided to buy this guitar. Had a Rogue 12 string a few years ago and sold it as I was not that impressed with it. What a difference with the Epiphone.  The fit & finish speaks quality. Playabilty is very good with low action and good tone. Really is a great buy!
