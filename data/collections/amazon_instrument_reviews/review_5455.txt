I play steel guitar and add effects to the song and different ones to my solos. I'm always looking for something that will add an extra appeal to certain songs. This is easily adjustable, and adds a depth and a near-Leslie sound. I use it often and it adds an interesting sound not possible with other effects. It's easy to use in combination with, for instance, a Chorus, or a Tremolo, for dynamic steel guitar sounds.
