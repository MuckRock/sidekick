Folks that like the original Ibanez Tube King will love this pedal.  Sturdier construction than most of Behrenger's other pedals-  The housing is metal and the knobs seem a bit more solid.  Folks talk about how bad the stock tube is, but that has not been my experience.  I may experement with a low gain JJ in the future, but the stock tube is staying put for now.  Maybe I got lucky and they 'hand selected' the right one?  This unit sounds really incredible when it's running into the front end of my EL84 powered tube amp.  The sound is really organic and gritty, with great harmonics and smooth sustain. Sounds decent but not nearly as good going into a solid state amp (no suprise there).  Still, an improvement from the sterile solid state tone.  Be forewarned - this pedal is gigantic in dimension.  Who cares, so long as it sounds this good??  I'd wanted a vintage Chandler/Butler Tube Driver forever, but now I honestly don't need one.  This pedal gets me there on the cheap!
