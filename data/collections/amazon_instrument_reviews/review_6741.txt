I've owned just about every muff.  No Triangle or Civil War.  But this is my favorite muff thus far.  Way more versatile than any other muff.  The switches involment in the the circuit really isn't too elaborate, but then again all bypasses aren't.  I love wicker on and tone off.  Cuts like a buffalo.  I hate to have a bunch of fuzz's and distortions in my chain, but its there right next to a Keeley Fuzz Head, a Analogman Peppermint Fuzz, and a TS-9 modded to an 808 w/ Brown that I modded myself.  I love this Muff!  I can't wait to see what they do next.  Plus...  These new EHX pedals are build tough as nails and full true bypass.  If you like muffs, you'll really like this one.  If you didn't like muffs before, you'll probably like the wicker feature, it makes it far more clear and pronounced and less of a glob a goo and more distortion/ fuzz friendly.  I give it four stars, because the five is only meant meant for devices that you just freak out and half to have, for me the Keeley Fuzz Head is a five, I love that thing.
