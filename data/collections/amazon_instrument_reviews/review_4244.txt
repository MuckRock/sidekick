There's nothing not to like about this capo.  I have two of them.  I've played guitar for over 40 years and have used other types of capos.  I like this one's low profile and the fact that you provide the pressure to the fretboard (by turning a knob to tighten it) rather than rely on a spring, as on the clip-on type. It takes a few seconds longer to install than the clip-on type, but I like the results better.
