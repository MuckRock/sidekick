It really nice, made in Canada not China wow! That alone impressed me! Like the other here, reviews it is not soft it is stiff material. Yes you can bend it. It will probably last 2 life times. Ends are made of leather. One advantage is that once you set it to the appropriate length it will not change easily. If your switching to different size guitars, this could be a problem cause you can't make an on-the-fly quick adjustment on stage, you will be wrestling with it.
