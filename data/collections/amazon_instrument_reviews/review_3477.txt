After using D'Addario strings I've try to Ernie Ball strings. I have ten years ago with Ernie Ball strings and let me tell you that it's the best strings. In comparison with Regular Slinky, this strings have a little heavy powerfull sound for funk, clasical rock and indie sound. I have an Stratocaster and let me tell you that sound balance being hybrid gives much versatility to play different genres.
