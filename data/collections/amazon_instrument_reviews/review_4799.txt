For the multi guitar owners, I think this is great.All I was looking for, something to patch guitars to amp without drastic tone/volume changes.Set up single coil, and another line humbucker, or p90 guitar and have the same volumes. Excellent... And space saver.  Sure there's a lot more options, but not likely ill use, just to make guitar switching easy good deal.
