as another guy said &#34;not better not bad simply different&#34; it's true. i have dunlop classic wah, beautiful and it sounds good, but there are certain feautures, in this one and in the dunlop, that i do not like.dunlop:-has a little bit of more wah range than behringer-i do not like the fact that u have to active and disactivate to use it-more expensive than the behringer-to my ears kinda affect just a little bit  the tone of your guitar when in usebehringer:-cheaper-does not affect the tone of your guitar at all, very transparent-more features than dunlop-wha sound is not like the dunlop's, it is different but nice, i personally like.so bottom line, im using this one for my pedal board for my electric guitar and the dunlop for the one in my acoustic.good deal, just get it, i highly recommend it.thank you again behringer your pedals kick real butt.
