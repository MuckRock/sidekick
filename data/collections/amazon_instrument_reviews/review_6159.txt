This is an excellent choice if you're looking for a nice analog delay with a small footprint.It looks great, it's easy to use, and it's a fantastic size for a delay pedal.The analog delay is nice and warm -- much more satisfying than digital delay to my ears. Also, the modulation button enables you to add a chorusing effect to the delays.There is a internal adjustment that I don't think I will need to use for now anyway.I highly recommend it !
