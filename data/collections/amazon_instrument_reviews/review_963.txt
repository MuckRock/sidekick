I bought this product with the notion of being cheap No refills to buy, except distilled water.  In all actuality, its a really simple design.I like this design better because of one simple fact.  If the wood in your guitar is already dry, you'll have to refill your humidifier more often initially.  i'd rather be using distilled water than hydration pack refills that are required in some other guitar humidifiers.  After the guitar gets "hydrated?", I usually end up wetting the sponge every 4 to 7 days.  It definitely gets taken several time between refills, so it's not that much of a hassle.Overall, good product that you could probably fashion yourself but why bother.  Try not to over-douse the sponge in order to avoid water damage to the guitar.Peace out and cheers~J
