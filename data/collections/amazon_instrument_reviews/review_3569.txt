If you find yourself in need of a desk mount for your microphone, this one works well. It is heavy enough to keep the microphone from tipping over, and the black anodized stem gives a subtle appearance on the desk. Having the microphone always plugged in, accessible on the desk and ready to go means I save much setup time for my voice-over work.
