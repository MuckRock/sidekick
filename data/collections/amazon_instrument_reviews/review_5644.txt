To me, there's not too much depth you can go into when describing guitar picks. Either they feel good in your hand, or they don't. Either they kind of &#34;disappear&#34; when you're playing, or they feel like a hindrance. These Dunlops get it just right. Enough grip to where you're not fumbling all over the place, and they somehow get out of the way of your playing. They're right up there with the Fender Classic picks, as my all-time favorites to use.
