I bought this stand because I needed support for larger songbooks that my metal fold-up could not provide.  I really, really like it. Others in my music groups that have seen it have also gone out and ordered one.  It assembles quickly and easily, and folds up into a nice package for transport.  Every once in a while I have to tighten the lock cams, but that is no issue.  It is very sturdy and holds big music books very well.
