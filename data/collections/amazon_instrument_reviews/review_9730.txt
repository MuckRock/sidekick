When I tried it out the first time the octave seemed to be intermittent. Noting that this product comes from China the first thing I suspected was cold solder joints.  I warmed up the soldering iron and opened 'er up and YES!  not only were there cold solder joints but there was a small piece of loose wire shorting components at random. Typical of quality control in the People's Republic of China. A little touch-up with the soldering iron and it's back to normal, whatever that is.  I'm a bit disappointed with the octave but I'm keeping it because it's a good fuzz (and I voided the warranty).  The Normal/Mid-Cut switch is part of why it's a great fuzz.I think I'll replace the Fuzz control with a pot that provides a wider range before going into supersaturation but the rest of the controls I'll leave alone.Dislikes:  quality of Chinese products is a crap shoot.Likes: it's a good, affordable effect
