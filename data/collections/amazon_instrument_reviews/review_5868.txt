One of the strap buttons on a guitar I was given as a gift was missing.  I was told that it would need some minor repairs, so all I had to do was replace a strap button and get some strings for it.This strap button was screwed right in the minute I got it and it worked like a charm.  I put the strap right on afterwards and started playing it and it hasn't given me any problems.
