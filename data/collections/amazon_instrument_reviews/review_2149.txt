I've used these since I fist started playing, always trying the latest and greatest along the way, but I keep on coming back to these. They have a great feel to them, sound twangy and great, have decent durability, are cheap as all get out, and have the best multi pack deals out there(especially on Amazon)....I simply don't see any reason to switch atm. Try 'em out, you'll like 'em :)
