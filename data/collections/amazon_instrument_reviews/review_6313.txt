This is really a no frills stand, except the addition of a neck guard strap, which is a nice touch. It is adjustable for different size guitars and quite stable. There's really not a lot more to say about it, except that, at $7.95, i dont see how you could possibly be disappointed. I would certainly not spend 20 or 30 dollars on a stand when i could buy one of these.
