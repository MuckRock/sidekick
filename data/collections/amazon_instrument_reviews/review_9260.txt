this pedal ...i tried it out thru a silver face fender twin...wow, it cranks,..!..it really will produce marshall plexi tones....especially noticeable in the lower registers...on the E and A strings...if you want a marshall  stack sound , this is it,,,if you wanty a variety , i would recommend using this in line with one or two other distortions, so you can chose any amp sound you need,,,really people, for these prices i bought one of every pedal these guys make...and they all are super,,!
