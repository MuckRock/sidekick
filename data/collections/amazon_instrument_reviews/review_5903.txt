This is my thrid Levy's strap and it is as good as the rest of them that I have had for a few years. I have this strap in black also and hope this one holds up to the rigors of the others. I have seen on different sites that the dye is thin but I don't see a problem with it so far and I use it regularly. I have it adjusted to the largest size and wished they were a bit longer, but it is a standard size.I prefer this strap over other cheap leather straps because of the build quality and the fact that they are made in Canada and not china or somewhere oversees with cheaper materials. For the price, the strap works well and I would buy more Levy's straps if needed.
