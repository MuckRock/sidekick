I've been playing guitar for years and lately I've been wanting some slinkier strings so I can get a little more bend out of them. I thought I'd try these out and I loved them. After playing with these for a week I loved the way that they played and I loved the way they sound. So I ordered 6 more packs of these. The extra slinky strings are fantastic and you definitely won't find a better set of strings for the money.
