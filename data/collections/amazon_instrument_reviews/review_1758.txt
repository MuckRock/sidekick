I wasn't sure about all the hype folks were giving this cable, but I am now - it really improved the sound of my acoustic guitar through the amp.I did a little experiment.  I plugged in my old cable, played the guitar as I adjusted the amp until I got a pleasant sound from the speakers.  Then, I turned the amp off, unplugged the old cable and plugged in this new Monster Rock cable.  Next,  I simply turned the amp back on (the sound levels were already set and I did not touch them) and played my guitar again.  The volume was louder and I think nicer with the new Monster cable.I'm buying a few more Monster Rock cables to replace all my old cables.
