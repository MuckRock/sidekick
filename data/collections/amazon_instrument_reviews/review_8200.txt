I have used these type of clip on Tuners for quite some time and have 4 different brands.The SNARK however is absolutely THE BEST clip on tuner I've seen on the entire market and the price isperfect. They've come out with the SN-8 I hear, which I'll buy soon..Great Product..Don't leave home without it.
