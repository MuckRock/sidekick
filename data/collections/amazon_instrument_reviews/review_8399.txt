this a great cable for practicing at home. Coiled cables keep things tidy and avoide tangles. This product measures approx. 28" coiled, plug end to plug end. Thus it is pretty short, even when stretched out. For me, it is the perfect length for at-home use, especially when using two (amp --> pedal board --> guitar).not sure why it isnt available for order on Amazon anymore ... I just ordered mine two weeks ago.
