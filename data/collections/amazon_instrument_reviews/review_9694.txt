Reputedly the Joyo Us Dream is a copy of the Suhr Riot distortion pedal. After watching a side by side comparison on Youtube, I decided to buy one.I would describe the Us Dream as sounding like a bright Proco Rat with a little less sustain and a much tighter low end. It has an MXR style enclosure (that means you have to remove the back plate to change batteries) and a surprisingly narrow sweet spot. But for $48 dollars I'm  happy with purchase.
