The Behringer ACX-450 is a good looking, great sounding amp in a small package, but should be used at low to medium volume.  At higher volumes one has to take care with the equalizer to reduce bass and midrange, and also use the anti-feedback button, to avoid a "muddy" sound from too much (distorted?) bass.  This not an amp to play loudly, but rather for low-to-mid volume accompaniment in a smaller venue.As to the sound effects, it is great with 16 effects covering reverb, chorus, delay/echo and many combinations.  I especially like that you can have all the effects with totally different settings on either channel.  Also nice to have a separate XLR microphone input on channel 2.The CD/MP3 input is good for backgrounds (or maybe drum machine) when playing, or music during breaks, although one needs a cable with RCA plugs to connect it.  Lack of a headphone jack is a drawback, but is balanced by all the good things this little amp offers.Overall, a great sounding and very flexible amp for a low price, if you don't plan to crank it up too much!
