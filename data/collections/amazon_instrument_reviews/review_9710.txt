Let me just start out by saying that I've been playing guitar for over 30 years and have owned a lot of different pedals over all this time. I still own most of these units except for this one...the JoYo compressor. My setup is a very simple one...starting with a Stratocaster to compressor, wah-wah,  super-overdrive, boost pedal, delay, then straight into the front end of a tube amp with reverb & vibrato. I don't want to get into a long blown out history of all the compressor pedals I've tried over the years but I know why you want one and how to use them. This thing simply didn't work right out of the box. While the outside of this stomp box is all metal, the inside is full of very low grade parts from China. Loose wires and bad components were everywhere on the board. I ended up sending it back for a full refund. I don't in anyway blame the seller. They took care of me without a hitch and I would buy from them again...just nothing with the name JoYo on it. If you're only buying these based on price I would say buyer beware...you get what you pay for.
