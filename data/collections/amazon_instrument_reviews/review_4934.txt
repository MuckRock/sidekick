I had a BOSS Blues Driver pedal that I really liked, that is until I got this Behringer Tube Overdrive. For blues, you (or at least I) want a gritty, dirty sound, one that implies some of the hurt implicit in blues music. I was happy with the Boss, but I decided to try this B. pedal, and I'm glad I did. I compared them side-by-side, and the Tube Overdrive was much grittier, like a small tube amp pushed just past its clear sounding limit. It's perfect for the sound I want, and I can adjust the amount of distortion to my preference. Some like a LOT of that sound, but I prefer just enough to color the sound and shape it to my desires, leaving the rest to my playing and the dynamics of how I attack the strings.I've now retired the Boss pedal. In a careful comparison, the Boss had a cleaner and slightly more clear sound, which is not really an overdrive, but more of a distortion, but a clear distortion, if that makes any sense. It does add sustain, but it can't compare with the B. pedal's effect, which implies a power barely held in check, just exactly what I was after.
