When I first learned guitar, my buddies kept telling me I'd want a capo but I held out until just recently. The Dunlop is secure, doesn't scratch the guitar at all, and holds the strings down as it should. Instead of taking the time to adjust my tuning, I can use this to achieve the tone I want. Good item for the price.
