I use this to record my band and other songs into garage band. Plugged right in, no drivers to install, computer recognized it immediately. I am missing out on a lot of this thing's capabilities by using it only in garageband, but for what I need it for, it's perfect. I use it to make drum beats and to add tambourine and other percussion instruments for our tracks. I researched a ton before I bought this one. Touch sensitive keys are great although they are mini keys. I could have got a lot better midi controller, but for the money, this one suits my band's needs just fine.
