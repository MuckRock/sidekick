Very nice pop filter! I use it on all my condenser mics! It works perfect for those hard P's and strong S sounds. It's built very well and adapts to almost any mic stand. It makes DeEssing a lot simpler when mixing vocals. And it looks very professional! I wouldn't be on the mic without it, now that I know of the big difference it makes having it!
