I've been using these strings for many years. They hold their tune for a long time and have a nice, rich on the low end, sparkly on  the high end tone. Quality has always been very consistent. I play classic rock, 90's alternative, modern country, blues, and 80's metal on Les Pauls, Strats, Teles, Rickenbackers, and Gretsch's. Live and in the studio, these strings work for everything.
