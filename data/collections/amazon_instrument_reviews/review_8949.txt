This is simply one of the best velcro tapes out there. It is very well made and resistant to hold every pedal imagined. I would recommend to get a few roles of power-grip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the 'industrial' velcros included in most pedal boards and a one-meter roll (around 3 feet) wont last long, especially if you have a combination of both regular size (MXR or Boss) and bigger pedals like a Cry Baby Wah or a VOX Satchurator or Time-Machine Reverb or similar. You probably have a few thousand dollars invested in great pedals, even rare ones, so this would be great for you to keep them well-attached to your board and properly organized. Maybe the tape could be made a bit wider, perhaps 1/2 an inch more would be great. It would actually increase a bit the sticking surface. Still a great product/concept. A must buy!
