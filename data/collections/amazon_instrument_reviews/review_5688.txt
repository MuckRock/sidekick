My main headphones before were HD-280's, which I thought were pretty good, until I got these. I have several pair of HD-280's, one for mixing audio, one for practicing with drums (since they have decent isolation), and one for 'her' to use.I have one of these, and the amount of detail is great. I have a set of M-Audio BX8a's, and these have a touch more clarity, which considering the price difference...wow. For mixing audio though, can't use headphones when it comes to getting the stereo imaging right, but, I think these will get used for mixing more and more, with the finalizing on the BX8a's.I didn't know headphones could sound this good.
