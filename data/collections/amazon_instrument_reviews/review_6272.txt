Firstly let me address the &#34;adjustable backrest&#34;. There's nothing adjustable about the backrest. The seat moves forward and backward about two inches which actually is a considerable difference in how it feels leaning back against the backrest but the backrest itself doesn't move, the seat does. It also does not adjust up and down as you would think an &#34;adjustable&#34; backrest should. The backrest cushion actually has a hard stop top that prevents this. But the seat does adjust slightly forward and back (presumably this is the purported backrest adjustment the description repeatedly asserts) and it does adjust up and down over quite a range so adjusting for height should not be a problem. The footrest, however, is welded in place so if you plan to use the footrest you're again limited to where you can put the seat in height range.All this aside I am still giving the stool high marks because it's a fair price, it does fold down with some extra dis-assembly for transport to venues and I find it works well for me. But for how it works for me you should know: I wanted this initially to play sitting down without a strap. I found that no matter how I adjusted the stool that I was just not comfortable with how the guitar rested and so I use it now exclusively with a strap. In this way however it's actually really nice because I can use the footrest or not at will and I can also stand up, walk around and then sit back down at will. Without the strap, though, my playing dexterity is compromised by slight balancing required to keep the guitar from smashing to the floor (at least in my mind's eye).If you want a stool that folds up and goes with you this is not that stool. You do need to loosen the screws and take the seat post out and remove the backrest. Then you're left with several pieces to schlep. Not difficult but it would be tedious to do this every day.Overall though I am very happy with the way this stool feels. No more couch and kitchen chairs for me.
