I owned this pedal for many years, before finally trading it in on some other equipment.  It produces one sound extremely well, but it only does that one thing.  The sound it does very well is the late 60's/early 70's fuzz sound: "White Room, Black Curtains"; "Satisfaction"; "Ina Gadda da Vida".  Note:  this pedal produces very good sustain, but has really bad attack.  As such, it will not really do the "Whole Lotta Love" sound.  As I said, it does one thing very well, but its range even with classic rock is quite limited.  If you plan to cover songs with that classic fuzz sound, this pedal gets you 100% of that sound.  If you want to also cover other classic rock, you're gonna need at least one more overdrive/distortion effect.
