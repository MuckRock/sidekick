I bought this in 2012 to record music classes and workshops that I take in both acoustic / fingerstyle guitar as well as electric guitar, bass and percussion.  All of those environments are very different and require different approaches otherwise you'll wind up with only mumbling or with the sound blown out.  The DR-07MKII has worked well for over 100 classes recorded.This unit has been great for picking up the human voice about 20 feet away while it has been sitting on an extra tilted music stand.  With it set to auto level then I can take it to a loud percussion class or electric band class and it quickly adjusts itself to the environment.You can also set limits for clipping or set the levels manually.  I've needed to do that for classes that involved a lot of lectures but then bursts of high sound.  I was willing to let the bursts clip so that I didn't miss the human speaking around them.One little feature that I now love is the fact that you can preset the file names and it uses them followed by a number to create next file.  I set them for certain venues that take classes or even a class name if I know that I'm going to be taking only that class for a few weeks.  This makes it easy to copy to my PC and keep organized.
