I'd give this 1 and a half stars if I could. This little Amp is so noisy if you hardly touch/move a cable plugged into it. It is so hard to get full sound in head/earphones with this. I can only hear in one ear in every headphone/output, and hardly anything in the other. I have to always adjust my cable's connector to get any full sound for a second. I can still use this, but hardly. I really don't like this.
