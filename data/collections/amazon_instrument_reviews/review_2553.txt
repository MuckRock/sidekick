Just slipped this windscreen on my mic (a wireless brand) and it barely fit perfectly. Any smaller and it would be going in the trash.The foam is obviously of good quality and it's plenty thick. I'm using it mainly to protect the mic's metal screen, but also to keep others' germs off the mic (seeing as how they tend to put their mouths on it!).
