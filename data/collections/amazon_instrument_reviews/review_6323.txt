I was a little unsure when I was unpacking this stand as the actual rack swings side to side. When I put my guitar on it, it was fine, it held perfectly. This cradles my guitar nicely. I just wish that it was like the one in the picture and was straight. It actually reclines back fairly far. Well, father than it looks like it would in the pics. I will recommend this to anybody in my life who ends up needing a guitar rack in the future.
