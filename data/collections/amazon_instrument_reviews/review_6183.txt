This inexpensive pedal kicks ass, provides everything from subtle spring reverb to VAST cathedral-like reverb. The 'Space' setting is unique in that it adds an interesting modulated overtone a couple octaves above the sounded note, providing a strange harmony. Some people pick on Behreinger because they're stuff is (still) cheap. I admit that two of their pedals (of the 10 that I have bought) underwhelmed me. This one is a keeper!
