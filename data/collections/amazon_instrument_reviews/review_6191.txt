Thought I would give this pedal a shot since it was inexpensive and sounded really good in the online videos posted for it.  Pros:  Very good sound quality, many options for echo to suit every individual taste, bright blue & flashing red (for tap tempo) LED's, stereo - dual out/in operation, tape + analog + digital types of delay = awesome, guitar signal "smooths out" when engaged, and class A bypass.  Cons:  Volume decrease by a hair when you engage the pedal, signal becomes a little bass-ier (but it sounds good) with the analog echoes, batteries go FAST (get the adapter).All in all, it was worth the money.  Comes with a warranty too, so no reason not to try it.  A lot of options available with this good-sounding pedal.
