This is an ingenious clutch that engages when you step on your hi-hat pedal, but will drop to the closed position when you hit the lever on the top. This allows you to either ride closed hi-hats when using both bass pedals, yet return to normal hi-hat playing when the music calls for it.Be aware that this clutch has only two positions - open and fully closed. However, there is a way to work around this if you like partially open hi-hats in the closed position for a sizzle sound.  I did a work around by placing a spring on the hi-hat stem, with metal and felt washers on the top of the spring, which gives me that opening when I drop the cymbal to closed.  There was a lot of trial and error finding the right spring because each cymbal pair has a different height when mated together, and I was looking for a tiny fraction of an inch opening.  Too small or low a tension a spring and stickwork chokes the sound. Too large or stiff and you will not get the sound.  However, this is all personal preference, and many drummers ride a fully closed hi-hat anyway, which makes this clutch perfect out of the box.Regardless of your hi-hat style, if you are using a double bass, this is a "must have" accessory. Gibraltar's model is solid, heavy duty, and engages and disengages perfectly every time.
