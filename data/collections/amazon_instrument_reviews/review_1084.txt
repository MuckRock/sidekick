I had some other rosin that was just a mess to apply.  This rosin is great because it's encased in a wooden sleeve that leaves your fingers free of rosin.  It's so easy to apply and doesn't leave any messy residue on my fingers.  I haven't been playing the violin for very long but did know I needed something to rosin the bow easily.  This was exactly what I needed.
