This is just like any other microphone stand. It works the same and is pretty durable. The weight at the bottom will definitely stop it from falling if someone were to acciddently bump into it...which is great, but could also be bad if you want to carry the stand around a bit. In order to do that you must either support the weight, which can be a pain or unscrew it from the base. Other than that, it's great.
