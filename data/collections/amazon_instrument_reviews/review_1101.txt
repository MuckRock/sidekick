I was unsure what kind of polish to get for my guitar.  I would have thought pledge would work, but after a little reading I found out that could be bad for the woods tone and resonance.  After scoping out Amazon I came up with this product, and I am happy.  It makes my black guitar shine and is very easy to use.  It also comes with a nice polishing cloth...great deal for the money.
