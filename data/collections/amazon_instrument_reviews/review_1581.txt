I'm using the guides to replace factory guides on my Strat and Tele. They will require that I drill a shallow hole to seat the guide properly. I hate drilling holes in guitars but it has to be done.  The quality of these guides is not what I expected. They are cast and plated and have some rough edges to them. If you want a very clean looking finish I would look for a higher quality guide. At this point I'm not even sure that I will use them.
