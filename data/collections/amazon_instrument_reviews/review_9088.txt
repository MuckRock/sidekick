While I wouldn't trust these to hold up my electric guitars, I have found other uses for them and have 2 of them now. The 1st one I used to try and hold my Dean From Hell guitar but it just mashed that foam around the yokes into nothing and didn't want it to damage my baby. So I ended up using it to hang my Rock Band guitar. This 2nd one I'm using to hang up my Beats Pros.I chose this product over some simple hook to hang my headphones is because of the foam covered yokes. I figured if you spread the weight over 2 cushioned points instead of a single unprotected point of a hook that the head cushion would hold up better. And the distance of the yokes means that the ear cushions won't ever touch the wall.This is a fantastic product if you understand it's limitations. I would recommend this for acoustic instruments, any type of RB/GH guitars, and probably your lighter/cheaper/mostly plastic electric guitars...or even headphones that you'd like to baby.
