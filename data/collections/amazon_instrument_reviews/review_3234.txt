This is a pretty good way to hold a mic if you want to amplify foot-stomping percussion (traditional to French Canadian music).  The base is really heavy, which makes it stay in place well, but it's a pain to carry around.  Also, since buying this I found out that I could just use a shoe to mount a mic by my feet, which would have been a bit cheaper.
