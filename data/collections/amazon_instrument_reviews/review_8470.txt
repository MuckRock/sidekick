I got mine in a trade for practically nothing. I figured I could sell it and make a few bucks, saw the Mustang amp around but never gave it any credibility, looked like a toy to me. Anyway I decided to plug it in and was shocked at the full sound of the little 8 inch speaker. I researched and found there is a program called Fuse that can interface with the amp. I downloaded and linked to the amp, there I saw you can make a lot of changes that can't be done with just the knobs. I saw it had a Deluxe Reverb setting. I have the Deluxe Reverb Reissue so dialed in the same settings with the fuse software. To my amazement it sound like a smaller version of my Deluxe! Fender really got close with the modeling. I went ahead and programmed a few more patches and set up a footswitch to change between 2 settings. I liked it so much I went out and bought the Mustang II. I almost like the Mustang I better but the II does have enough power to gig with if you aren't a loud band. I will leave my Deluxe Reverb at home for my next small gig and use the Mustang, maybe even the little one and mic it up..
