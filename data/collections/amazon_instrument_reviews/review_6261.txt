I use this stand for a smaller 50 watt Fender amp.  I don't think I would recommend it for larger amplifiers, especially since it sits a little high, but for my amp, it's perfect.  Nevertheless, I also don't really plan on packing it up or moving the stand around much, so I can't imagine it being ideal for portability.  If you have a music studio and are doing more recording and/or rehearsing than playing gigs, this is a really nice stand.
