This strap seemed a little awkward at first, but after a rigorous six month evaluation it's become my go-to strap.I currently have it locked to a Fender Strat and experience NO problems with the strap ends rubbing against the body of the guitar.  Although the strap ends are light plastic, they've held up well.  The nylon strap itself has held up well with no fraying or noticeable wear.  The nylon isn't that soft, so if you are that guy who insists on playing shirtless then this may not be the strap for you.It will lock to most standard strap ends, if the body of your guitar allows it.  I wasn't all that happy with this strap connected to a Les Paul.
