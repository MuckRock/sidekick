This little amp is exactly what my son needed for his acoustic guitar's output while playing outside on the porch. The amp produces a much "bigger" sound with much better quality than expected. This does eat up 9v batteries so we also picked up an AC power adapter for when he uses this in the houses.We also like that this has a headphone jack, which cuts the sound to the speaker when plugged in.Highly Recommend! Note: We have the "Burgundy" color one.CFH
