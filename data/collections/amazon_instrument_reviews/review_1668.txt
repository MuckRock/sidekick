Like other reviewer wrote previously, I received less picks than advertised (I received a total of 7 picks). I don't know if the people at customs "borrowed" some from me, but I find very strange that more than one person is having the same problem. Other than that, the picks are good, seem to be durable and produce a nice sound.
