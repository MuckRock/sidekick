I play with fingernails and just can't control standard metal banjo-style fingerpicks because I can't feel the strings. I used Alaska picks for years, which are very good. These are better. They give the control of nails, yet the tone and protection of metal - and I can feel the strings! Muting, harmonics, everything...  If you play with nails and want finger picks, these are for you.
