Price is Right for entry level. Using as a backup or on my mixer when using my higher quality short stand during recordings. The Mic mount was a PLUS, using it for one Karaoke "Cheap Mics" It is just pop-riveted on so a Bit LOOSE, but could improve with a little 2 part epoxy. Only thing keeping it from 5 stars! Still for the money a great buy...
