Seriously, just stop.Don't be like me and wonder what all the fuss is for years, just go ahead and get a pair. They are just awesome. When I finally got mine, I opted for the anniversary edition as they were on sale, and I am seeing the regular athm50s right now for $119!! That's crazy cheap.I had some rather inexpensive Sony headphones for about eight years(still have them actually) that are comfy and sound good, but not entirely accurate. The ATHM50S are really solid studio headphones. I can't imagine why I have taken soooooo long to try them for myself. They exude quality and are comfy, even when I'm wearing my glasss which many headphones are not. Not for long seasons anyway.I use the ATHM50S in my home studio and I have started taking them along in my gear bag for studio sessions along with a 15' headphone ext cable.I feel oSo foolish having lived without these cans for so long, don't you do the same!
