The Planet Waves Tri-Action Capo features a trigger action, which makes it easy to put on and remove, compared with any other style of capo I've ever used.  As the product description says, it has a built-in pick holder, which certainly is not necessary, but which is a feature that some users will find attractive.  If the photo on the Amazon product page looks confusing, don't worry.  What looks like a spring actually is a spring.  The spring mecahnism is adjustable, similar to the way that vise-grips work.  This capo is adaptable to guitars with various neck radius shapes, and narrow neck, standard acoustic guitars, as well as acoustics with wider necks (e.g. Godin's Seagull guitars).  The only quibble I have--and it's a minor one--is that when you get the spring mechanism set up for one guitar, you may need to adjust it when you switch instruments.  Once adjusted, though, the downward tension on the strings seems to work well with no fret buzz.
