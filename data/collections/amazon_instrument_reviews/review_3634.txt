Recieved this item today in preparations for a halloween party, upon installation and testing, the unit blew a fuse..Going to buy another fuse to see if it was a random thing, if not, I'll be returning mine.. will update...UPDATE.. Radio Shack carries the correct fuses for this unit, upon changing the fuse the unit works as expected..Leaks a bit while using , so dont stand under it...But most on these things leak anyway..
