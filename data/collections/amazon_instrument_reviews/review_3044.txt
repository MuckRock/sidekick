Great universal power supply for your pedals, and the ability to mount it under your board makes it awesome. I have two of these that I mount under my board and they power all my pedals perfectly. Would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a unit to power all their pedals with, and you won't get any noise interference with its isolated outputs.
