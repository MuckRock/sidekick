I am editing my earlier review.  I bought 2 of these about 6 months ago.  One works just fine, no problems whatsoever, I use it on every gig and at home.  The other has some kind of short in it.  It drains batteries almost overnight.  When I take the batteries out, no problem.  Tunes just fine, but I am sure over time the battery harness will break as it is made of flimsy plastic materials that surely will not stand this kind of test.I contacted Snark and Marcy, their customer service rep, sent me a new one free of charge even though the tuner was out of warranty.  Excellent customer service!  They have earned my loyalty even if their products are not perfect because their service is!I will edit this review later if the replacement turns out not to work perfectly.
