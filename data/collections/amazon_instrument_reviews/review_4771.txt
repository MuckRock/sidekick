This is a well assembled and packaged unit, designed to a price. So certain compromises have been necessary.Compromises such as a single-supply wall wart - partly an advantage to get the AC out of the amplifier itself - and very basic circuit, with inexpensive parts. The preamp supports only moving magnet cartridges, and has no provision for load adjustments or the like.On the other hand it works well, is packaged nicely, and serves its purpose for folks who are not audiophiles or fussy, but want a basic phono/RIAA amp for their turntable to connect to line inputs. Also, by avoiding the &ldquo;all-in-one&rdquo; tendency of units that include inexpensive D/A converters and such for USB output, this is almost certainly cleaner for the analog-only uses for which it is suited.The unit is also very &ldquo;hackable&rdquo; if you'd like to upgrade things like capacitors, resistors, or the opamps. Or use a nicer external power supply - the first thing I'd upgrade. Lastly, if you know the ideal capacitive load for your cartridge, and the capacitance of your phono cables, you can adjust the loading on the inputs accordingly.Recommended if your budget is limited.
