Quality of these casters is what you would expect if you own any Ernie Ball products,great, very easy to install they hold tight in their sockets and roll smoothly on hard surfaces, not intended to be used on turf on loose surfaces. I have them on several bass cabinets, they also remove easily for stationary cabinet use.
