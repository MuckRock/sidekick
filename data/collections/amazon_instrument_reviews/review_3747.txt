I read the reviews here on Amazon and was kind of turned off of buying it at first. Eventually I went ahead and sprung for it since it wasn't expensive. I only needed one, and expected the package to come with just one, but it has two locks so that was a pleasant surprise. I've had them for 2-3 months now and they haven't failed me yet. They keep the strap in place just fine and are fairly sturdy for plastic pieces. Really helped a lot because my strap would keep slipping off the knob and I had to use my ninja skills to get the guitar before it hit the floor. The only complaint I have is that they fit a bit tight with my strap (though it could be my nylon strap is just a bit too thick) and they are an EXTREMELY snug fit which makes me kinda nervous. However, I keep them as tight as I can while still allowing them to rotate a bit so everything is fine so far. Not sure why the other reviews were so negative, but I have no complaints.
