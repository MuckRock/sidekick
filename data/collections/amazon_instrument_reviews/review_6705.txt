This is the first guitar I've bought without playing it first, so I was apprehensive. But it's a fine guitar. It's plain to look at - no decoration or embellishments, but the sound is rich and full, as if it were at least ten years old. I like the nut width and the action is perfect for my playing. The tuners are geared low, which allows precise tuning. It came with Savarez strings - not the best I've used, but good. And I was pleasantly surprised with the gig bag. It's strong and durable, and well designed. All in all, I doubt I could have found a better quality product for such a low price.
