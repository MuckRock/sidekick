I have seen people complain about battery life. I turn it on, tune, and then turn it off and my batteries last forever. The display is good, and the tuners work well. I have four of them and have compared them for accuracy and sensitivity. I think it is a well made product and good value. Thank god for tuners. There is nothing worse than a bunch of out-of-tune, loud guitar players.
