I bought some of these a few years ago just to try them out.  The "gel" in the name sounded intriguing.  These are OK, the colors are bright, but otherwise they're just standard plastic picks, which on an electric I prefer nylon because it's less "clicky" on the strings.  These are fine, and if I pull one out of my gig bag I'll use it, but overall there are other styles of pick that I'd buy before buying these again.  Nothing wrong with them, but they're just normal plastic picks, nothing special other than maybe the brightness of the colors.
