Ok, so I had to buy another item because 2 items in my cart were "add-on" items.  I needed another microphone and I had been toying with the idea of purchasing a GLS mic.  I'm extremely happy I took the chance, and as soon as I submit this review, I'm purchasing another.  This is the best price/value purchase I've made in a long time.  I'm not going to insult your intelligence and say it's the same as the other well-known mic that looks the same, but for my ears and everybody else who's listened to this mic, it sounds clear and clean and is a little hotter than my SM 58.  I just used it to play a show on Friday the 24th, and it performed wonderfully.  The sound guy thought it was an SM 58.  I will definitely buy a couple of the ES-57s as well to mic up some amps.  Now, things may change in a year if the mic doesn't hold up, but it is hefty and solid, and seems to be built like a tank.  Now, if I was dripping money, maybe I would stick with the "industry standard," but when you can buy these at a 3:1 dollar ratio, why on Earth should I?2/6/2014 update: I must say that in some venues, you'll really have to tweak the EQ in order to stop feedback.  So while they are a great value, they feedback in some situations where my Sennheisers do not (but they were 4 times the price. . .).
