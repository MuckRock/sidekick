Needed some chorus in my tone and this fit my budget. I have owned multiple Behringer products and trust the brand. It is a plastic casing but I don't tour so that won't be a problem - I needed the effect and it gives it. Fully adjustable for depth, tone, warble and volume. Don't spend $200 on a 'boutique' pedal - get this one.
