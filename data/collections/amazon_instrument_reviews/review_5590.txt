I have only used one of these with a hybrid tube amp and a solid state but I hear that it will work with either tube or solid state amplifiers. It really gives my amplifier a warm overdriven sound. This pedal can be used to boost your guitar sound during solos or certain guitar parts. This pedal has three preamp settings: Ts9, Hot, +, and Turbo. It's great for solos and warm blues or rock rhythm guitar. One nice thing about this is it responds well to how soft or hard you pluck the strings. For example: if you set on the "Turbo" setting and pick with your fingers it will clean up nicely. If you pluck hard it will make a smooth distorted sound. If you want a metal sound, then I recommend the Metal Zone by Boss/Roland.BOSS MT-2 Metal Zone Overdrive Distortion Pedal
