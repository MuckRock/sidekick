I had two of these and wound up selling one because I never used it. The one I kept is currently serving as a keyboard amp for two keyboards (simultaneously): aRoland RD-300NX Digital Stage Pianoand aRoland V-combo 76 Key Stage Keyboard. I was able to do this because there are two inputs on the front of the amp. Input 1 is designed for normal sensitivity and Input 2 is designed for guitars with active pickups. Thus far I have had no problems with both boards connected at the same time, and it does not seem to matter which board is connected to which input.The sound is impressive. Exceptionally clean, and the amp provides controls to allow you to contour your sound, which helps significantly when running keyboards through it.  Moreover, the amp is loud if you choose to make it so, and even at high-gain settings it has ample headroom.If you want distortion, this is probably not the amp for you. You can switch it from clean to drive to more drive, but it is essentially still a clean sounding amp. I find this to be a plus, but I have met my share of guitarists who think otherwise.Another great feature is you can daisychain these amps using the Pre-Out on the master to the Pwr-In on the aux amp(s). You can also use these two jacks to run an effects loop. I personally have no use for those features, but I can see how they could be useful.Overall, I love the amp and wish Fender made a single 12" model because it is pretty heavy and bulky. Those are hardly significant complaints since I sometimes regret selling my second one because if something happens to the one I still have I would replace it immediately.
