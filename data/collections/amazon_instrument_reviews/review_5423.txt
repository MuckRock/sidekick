Im using this with five pedals and it works great. No added noise, no signal loss, and saves the cost and hassle of constantly replacing 9V batteries.Comes with a nice assortment of adapters for use with just about any brand of pedal out there.probably not the most durable power supply available, but for the price, it cant be beat.
