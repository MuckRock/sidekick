As a kid I learned to play the trombone proficiently, but my heart wasn't really in it, so I took up the guitar, which I love. I played for several years but stopped playing for lack of time. I recently started playing again and was looking for the perfect pick for classic rock (I have an old Ibanez and a Les Paul Custom) and have tried several picks in that quest. There are several I have liked (and several that I haven't) but thus far my favorite is the 1.0mm Tortex (blue) picks. They have a very nice, almost powdery, matte feel that minimizes slippage and they just don't break, though the 1.0s are fairly stiff. Depending on what you are playing there are various thicknesses available, and most people will find something suitable for their personal preferences. I won't say that I will never try anything else, but thus far I find myself picking up my 1.0 Tortex more than other picks.
