This pick-up sounds good and does actually sound like the guitar acoustically.  It does pick up percussive noise which you don't get with under saddle pickups.  It is prone to feedback in very loud situations if you don't use a sound hole cover.  Over all I'm please because I was able to install myself and it was simple.  You do need to use an external pre-amp, but even with piezo pick-ups that is usually the norm.  The directions that comes with the pickup are very thorough and the company is helpful if you have questions.  The only change I had to make to my guitar was making the end pin jack bigger and that was easy too.
