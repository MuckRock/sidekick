Let's' be very clear from the start: The pedal board and the carrying bag are excellent quality. The board is solid, and the bag is very well made and will last a life-time. As other people have pointed out though, Pedaltrain must have outsourced the decision to locate the strap D-rings to someone who has never carried anything over their shoulder. The only reason this is not a 5-star review is because of the D-rings. That being said, don't let that detract you from buying this. I just feed the shoulder strap through the carry-handle and it works well enough.
