This is great product if you are chaining several pedals together. Using just one wall wart you can power all of them, at least those that receive this kind of power 9v. Where it went above and beyond duty was providing a L6 converter 'CL6' for Line 6 products. I have an M-Audio Black Box which had a peculiar size plug. It was 9V 1000ma but nothing would fit. Then I tried the L6 converter and bingo I'm in business and Black Box bliss. I would recommend having it around just for that. It costs about the same as 1 odf any other kind of converter and gives you connecters for several different kinds of pedals which might just save your night when you can't find that particular adapter in the rats nest of other adapters. A pedal junkies salvation.
