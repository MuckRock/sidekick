So, you just spent all your money on a guitar and do not want to spend much more accessorizing.  This strap is perfect, even if you do have the money to spend and just looking for something that will do the job well.The materials are 1)high quality soft nylon for the strap - it feels kind of like a non-stretch ACE bandage, 2) durable non-scratching/marring plastic for the links and adjuster and 3) a thick rubber material for the ends.The thickness of  rubber material for the end secure the the straps pretty well. They do not slide of the strap pegs very easily. I say rubber like because they seem more like a synthetic leather but with more flexibility. Again this material seems to be non-marring.All this and a secret compartment for picks.Overall, a fantastic product with a price that can't be beat.  Highly recommended.  Five stars.
