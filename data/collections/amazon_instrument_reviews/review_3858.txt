I'm never playing another guitar without these locks!After my Custom Telecaster fell. The neck went out of wack, I had to readjust the truss rod and spend hours to setup the guitar again! That's every musician's nightmare!I immediately started doing research for a proper locking mechanism for my straps. Schaller kept coming up. I looked at the design and was confident it was safe to use.One issue you may run into is the nut running loose. That's not a problem with the scaller locks, it happens to anything that uses these type of nuts (it has happened on my guitars where the input jack is). A drop of glue around the threading can fix that issue easily.
