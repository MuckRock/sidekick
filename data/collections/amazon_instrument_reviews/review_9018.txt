I bought the wrong pack(Was supposed to buy the light/medium pack) but its alright these picks let me try out a bunch of different gauges and materials to see what fit me best. My favorite pick out of this bunch was  the Dunlop Jazz 3 pick. It would be great if the item name was changed to like 'Dunlop 12 Med/Heavy pick variety pack' but that might be me being too picky.
