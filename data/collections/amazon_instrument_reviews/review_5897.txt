I usually don't buy many guitar straps, and when I do, I like to get a thick, leather-type one, because I've found any other strap seems to bite into my shoulder after a while, and I don't like having metal pieces on the strap that can scratch up my instruments.  I bought the black version; I think my days of jumping around and sweating while playing are over, so I probably won't worry about running colors (but I will keep an eye out for such a thing).  It's very adjustable (just not quickly adjustable), worked perfectly with my Straplocks, and keeps my 45 pound (it seems like it, anyway) Les Paul from digging into my shoulder.  The 2.5 inch width is fine for me, but if you're spending long hours strapped to a heavy monster, I'd go up to the 3 inch model, especially if you're going to be bouncing around for the greater part of 5 hours.
