I've had Behringer mikes before, and currently have a couple of XM2000s, which are very reliable and comparable to Shure SM 58s. I saw this three pack of 1800s for $40 in a hard case and couldn't believe it. I hooked them up right beside the 2000s, and while there is a little difference, it's not much. The 1800 has a little more high end, but it's easy to adjust the tone for slightly more bass. The presence is also boosted a little on the 1800, meaning less reverb should be put in the mix to avoid a tinny sound or the possibility of feedback.For now, I'm using the matched 1800s as the main mikes for our vocalists, and keeping the older 2000s as backups.I bought the 3 of these for less than the price of one SM 58. Although the Shure (and the B 2000) is better, the difference is hardly noticeable once the tone and presence are compensated for. I can afford to buy another 3 pack for complete backup.A wise choice for the budget conscious.
