well.. First of all, I am a beginner.. I do not know anything about guitar... I saw that some people complain about the corroded strings and buzzing frets... Mine came yesterday and I am afraid that it would have issue, so I brought it to school and let my professor checked for me.. It surprised me because mine does not have any issue at all.. The string does not corroded, but I changed mine anyway. The fret does not have any issue at all.. and the Truss rod adjustment is perfect.. The action is low and the guitar structure is perfect. When my professor starts playing it, he was surprised by the sound it produced. He thought the guitar cost $300 above!!... He also bought one this morning...haha...anyways, I buy it from amazon and the packaging is great!!...My guitar comes in a perfect condition, and I strongly recommended this guitar for anybody!!...
