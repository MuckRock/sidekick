I have an Acoustic B100 MKII 100 watt bass amp with a 15 inch speaker. My bass is an SX jazz bass. I have always loved the tone of my Acoustic amp, until now. After I plugged this little bad boy in, it brought my amp to life! Now, I cannot live without it. This is the Swiss army knife of bass preamps. Every bass player should have one of these. You can dial in tons of different tones and it gives your amp that tube-like sound. For 29 bones, you simply cannot beat it! Spend the extra 10 bucks and get the Behringer 9V power supply, so you don't have to worry about batteries. If you are a bass player, just buy it!!!
