I got this cable to run to my electronic drum set at the other end of the studio as a previous cable failed on me.  The balanced lead works well and the cable is very quiet.  Construction features too well soldered TRS 1/4&#34; male connections and the only downside I can complain about is the lack of strain relief...but nothing major and the cables work fine none the less.
