I teach class guitar in a community college and bought the SAT800 to loan to students during class. I selected it for the rubber bumpers and beefy build, expecting anything in this day and age to nail pitch quickly and accurately. And, indeed, it tunes acoustic and classical guitars without filching. Oddly, in one year of use, nobody has dropped it so the bumpers also provide a sure grip in hand and on music stand. My prior smooth plastic Seiko cost four times as much as the SAT800 but managed to hit the deck several times a week. Amazingly it still works perfectly but was not well suited for butterfingered students. However, the display was larger and sported colored note names, so it was more intuitive for beginner use.The built-in mic works fine in a quiet room but is useless in a classroom full of guitars (as are all built-in tuner mics). You need to use a tuner pickup and all is well (I use a Korg tuner pickup). If I were to nick pick I'd have to say the letter name of the pitch is way too small on the LCD. It's tucked in the far right corner in 12 point type and positioned just after the octave number. A lot of students can't read or notice such small type. Also the octave number immediately in front of the letter confuses many beginners as they assume it is the string number (doesn't matter how many times I explain that it isn't). Finally, it is too easy to accidentally recalibrate the pitch. Nearly every week somebody inadvertently sets it to A435 or whatever and causes a bunch of other students to be out of tune. A lock button or some other safety would be a smart design upgrade. Most of these nick picks don't apply to pros or advanced players but are something to consider if you're a novice.Add a calibrate safety feature and double the pitch name size and this would be a 5 star product. Right now it's a mere 4.5!
