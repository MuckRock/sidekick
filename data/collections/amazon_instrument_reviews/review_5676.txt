I agree with all the other reviews. These are high quality sounding, very comfortable (I have a big head too!), durable headphones with a nice long cable and spring reinforced headphone jack. Unless you make money with your headphones (or have money to burn) you probably don't need anything better than the M50's. The only thing I would change would be to get rid of the collapsible cans - they make the headphones take up less room when folded (good for travelling) but I'm old fashioned and prefer rigid phones, they are a bit quicker to get on and off when you don't have to unfold them and flip the cans in the right orientation. No big deal though! Comes with nice screw on 1/8" to 1/4" adaptor.
