This is an inexpensive, sturdy sustain pedal that I immediately buy every time I get a new Yamaha keyboard - This pedal feels very similar to the damper pedal on an acoustic piano - much better than any footswitch. Only issue is that due to the way different manufacturers configure plug polarity, it may or may not work properly with non-Yamaha keyboards...
