These are perfect. Hard to beat strings. They last, keep in tune, and keep their tone. They don't need any string cleaners either. So you can save money on that. An obvious noticeable difference between the Medium gauge and the Light is that these Medium gauge are not recommended if you like to finger-pick a lot.  But boy.... Are they bright! Enough to blow the spruce tops from pine trees!
