I was unaware when I originally purchased these that there was a threaded mic mount on the back extension pole. I already had a couple 13" posi-lok boom arms that I popped on them and was able to reclaim two floor mic stands and save a little bit more floor space. They are fairly well constructed for the price and fit perfectly in my small home studio. The mics are now perfectly positioned and dont get kicked around anymore.
