One Spot has become the standard. It is not cheap, but it is well made and useful. With this, you get the power adapter, the extension cable (to hook up multiple stomp boxes), and a bag full of converter cables. The power adapter is smartly built so that it will only take up one slot on your surge protector or in your wall outlet.So far, I have used it successfully only to power two pedals, so I cannot speak to how it handles powering an entire pedal board. But I am sure it would do so without issue as I have seen other do it without a complaint.
