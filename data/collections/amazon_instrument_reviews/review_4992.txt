When I first installed these tuners my guitar would still go out of tune. Mainly the second to the last string at the bottom and I later learned it was the wrong tuner and the string tree was too blame. Sometimes I just don't pay attention to the obvious;)It turned out that there are 3 short tuners and 3 long ones. The long ones go on the top 3 strings, the short ones the bottom 3 strings, get that because I had them on incorrectly. And even worse, I was using the string tree which is the part that holds down the 2 bottom strings. The string tree(google guitar string tree and you'll see one) was actually making the strings not stay in tune with the locking tuners. I know silly but I was not paying attention.The reason you use the short tuners for the bottom is so the guitar will stay in tune! The string trees get in the way and when you whammy the strings go out of tune. Please take a note of that.Overall a good product.
