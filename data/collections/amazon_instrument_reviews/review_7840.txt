I bought this because I had a gig in a dark bar.  I used this on my music stand on the lowest setting and it worked perfectly.  For some songs I have three sheet of paper (which overlapped about an inch) and the light covered all three pages easily with no dark spots.  I can't imagine in what situation I would ever need to use the brighter setting. I was thinking of getting the cheaper/smaller version, but didn't want to risk it not covering three pages. The gig bag is a square and softly padded. There is a lot of dead space in the bag and no support in those empty areas or the corners so I don't expect much protection for the light or adapter.  Treat the light like it has no bag and you'll be fine.  They include 3 batteries (I didn't see them until I pulled out the adapter for this review) to get you started using the light, but the adapter works well and has a very long cord so if you are using the adapter at a gig you shouldn't have to worry about it making it to your power supply.
