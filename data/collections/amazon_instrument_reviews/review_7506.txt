Behringer makes a LOT of electronics for guitar and bass. I have an FCB10 that I use and like, great controller for the price. The CS400 at roughly 20.00 is a decent pedal that will 'get the job done'. Is it equivalent to a Boss, Dynacomp, Visual Sound or Keeley compressor...nope. You will get 20.00 worth of use out of it though for sure. The housing is pretty flimsey and when you change the battery its a PITA. Just don't take a flying leap to stomp on it and battery consumption is really low so with a lot of use you may have to change the battery once or twice a year. Good pedal for the beginner at an unbeatable price point.
