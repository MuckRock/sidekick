Since I paid about $13 for this, I was not expecting a great deal. What I received was a decent enough floor switch for a Fender Mustang I or II. It works well as a way to switch between two user-determined presets on my Mustang II. Construction is about as good as I would normally get on a $13 item. It would be nice if the switch design allowed greater flexibility, but that's a function of the Mustsng II design overall. I'm not grading the switch on that.If you have a compatible Fender amp and can get this for less than $15, then it's a good deal. If prices go above that, best to wait it out or check the pricing of used units on the Amazon Marketplace.
