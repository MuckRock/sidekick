I love this stuff. I've tried many fretboard and string cleaners but this one works the best. And in case you are wondering, it comes with a cloth cap attached to the bottle under the twist off cap so all you have to do is turn the bottle upside down and clean away. You may need an additional cloth in the beginning to wipe off the excess liquid because the bottle is full when you first get it (of course). I highly recommend this product.
