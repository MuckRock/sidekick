Liked the sound, the adjustability, just wish I could read the numbers on the dials as my ears are still ringing from turning the dial the wrong way! I find the unit surprisingly sturdy and it feels solid. I don't care about disturbing the neighbours, but it is handy to have a portable solution when traveling, the Rumble 75 is a bit big to take everywhere. I made sure to match it with good bass headphones which other reviewers have said is a must.
