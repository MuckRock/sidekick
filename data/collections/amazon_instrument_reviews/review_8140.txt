I've owned a bunch of tuners over the past 30 years and this one is the best I've ever had for an acoustic guitar.  It is easy to operate, has a nice large display that you can easily see and it's small enough to carry anywhere.  It is fast, accurate and the battery seems to last forever.  Nothing to complain about here, 5 stars all the way!
