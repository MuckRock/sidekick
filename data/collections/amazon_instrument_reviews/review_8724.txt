I compared this side by side with two other reverbs-1) The Boss '63 Fender reverb2) The Electro Harmonix Holy Grail.I found the EH- Holy Grail the most natural sounding and the simplest to operate with only 1 knob and one switch.The TC pedal did sound nice, but to my ears slightly sterile by comparison to the Holy Grail.I thought the Boss pedal sounded pretty bad.Pros of the pedal:- several settings and with all the knobs, highly adjustable- mono or stero (2 inputs, 2 outputs)- standard 9 volt power supply jack used by most pedals- I liked the spring reverb, and the "mod" reverb which was lush.Cons:- Sounded a little sterile compared to EH Holy Grail, but close and still good- I thought the number of different reverb settings was actually overkill and just there to look like it did a lot. To my ears, the rest were less distinctive.-Priced at $150, seemed a little high although I know there are other pedals that cost more.Overall a nice pedal, I can't really ding it for the cons above so I still gave it 5 stars. I had to compare a couple times to the EH holy grail to make my decision. In the end, the grail was cheaper, simpler and sounded more like a real reverb tank in my opinion.
