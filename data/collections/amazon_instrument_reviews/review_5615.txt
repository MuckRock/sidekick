I just got this and I've noticed that it when I activate the pedal it sucks almost all of the bottom end out of my tone... I have a crybaby that doesn't have the range the 847 does but its 10x's more transparent.  There may be other factors at play here as it is new, but the lesson is: try it before you just buy it to make sure it works for you.
