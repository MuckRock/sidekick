Reduces string noise as promised.  Makes slides much easier to accomplish with ease and less noise.  I think they also do reduce some finger soreness as your fingers aren't as irritated from sliding on bare strings.  Makes them feel kinda like elixirs, but sounds a lot better and you still have the naked strings feel.  Also does make the neck a lot smoother.  I will be buying more for all my guitar cases.
