I ordered this pedal based on the previous 2 reviews, but to me it sounds very tinnie and cheap, plus the control knobs were a bit tight and hard to adjust. I do a have a few Behringer pedals and many are very good for the price, but this one I won't be keeping. To me, it wasn't even close to as good as the Fender amp reverbs...
