It is so small that it cannot hold all mics. If you have a big lopsided kick drum mic  with a skinny neck and akward COG(AKG D112), this stand will not be able to hold it up. It can however hold up the Audix D6 and it can hold an SM 57 up to a guitar cab if its the right height. I love this because it has allowed me to mic things in really really tight spaces. I would never have had room to use full sized instrument mic stands in some of the tiny stages I have seen this summer. This thing takes up very little real estate, I have put this thing in the pocket of my jeans before!
