I am a beginner but I played this guitar non stop since I have bought it and I can honestly say from what I hear from my friends guitars they use ,it sounds better I did have to tune it tho because it was out of tune and my playing sounded different than the people on Youtube I was learning from so I used the snark sn1 tuner and it sounds great now no complaints here.
