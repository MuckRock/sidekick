I ordered the polyweb strings on the advice of some friends.  They didn't care at all for nanowebs which are widely available, but swore by the quality of the polywebs.  By some sort of mixup I got nanowebs by mistake.  I requested a return to get the proper item, and the seller offered to send me the polywebs and told me to keep the nanowebs for the trouble.  I haven't had a chance to test either set of strings out but I'm sure they'll be great.It's my understanding that the polywebs could practically be the last set of strings you ever buy (with some proper care).  I've been told that while nanowebs last longer than normal strings, they don't measure up to the polywebs.
