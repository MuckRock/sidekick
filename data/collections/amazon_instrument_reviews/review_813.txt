I absolutely love the feel of these guitar picks! They are so grippy, I haven't broken a single one yet, they stand out from all of the other junk in my studio, so it's hard to loose them, but I still do. If you have like a child, nephew, niece, sibling, or parent that plays guitar or bass you can't go wrong with getting these for them, or if you are a guitarist just playing the cheap little Fender picks that break if you strum a chord, and if you are lucky enough not to break them, they just slip out of your hands while you're playing. They are a little thin for rhythm playing however, and I recommend the .88 mm picks for that.
