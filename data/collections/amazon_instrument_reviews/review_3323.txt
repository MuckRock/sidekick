A great deal on what I consider the best all purpose guitar strings out there. Do the big names in the music biz use Ernie Ball strings? Yes, and for good reason. While it is true that you can attain a fatter sound with the heavier gauge variety, I have found that for my USA Stratocaster, that the ease of play with the &#34;9&#34; strings is the clincher -- and they provide an amazingly full sound, with no stress on the fingers at all.
