I have bought and used about every banjo strap known to man, the Neotech is by far superior to anything else I have hooked up to my Gibson ESS.  The straps are easy to hook and unhook, I have two sets on my banjo, one set for the Neo and another for the harness I use when the back needs a rest.  It's easy to uphook one and hook the other.  Well done and I like the bounce feature, softens out the jolts.
