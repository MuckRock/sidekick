Joyo continues to surprise me. This thing is all metal, looks very sleek, is true bypass, and all around works well.The individual bands actually light up, which is pretty cool.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was they forgot to drill a hole for the power indicator led left of the footswitch. You can see the led on nearly every other Joyo pedal for an idea of how it should look. However it doesn't even show up in the product picture on amazon. It wasn't a big deal, I just drilled a little 1/8&#34;ish hold and it fits through.
