This pedal, fish and chips, which i find it to taste nothing like, works nicely.And was pretty cheap..I've heard some complaints/worries about the flimsiness of the plastic.As of 03.13 the plastic seems pretty thick/durable.The switch does seem of a poor quality, but if it did break im sure either send it in and get a new one or put a nicer switch in yourself.As for noise, It doesn't seem to add much, unless you have the gain switch at the end turned up high, and with distortion and what have you.I haven't gotten to blast (play bedroom level, technically) since i've gotten it, but it sounds good through the headphones.I'm using a squire strat, fryette sas distortion, now the fish and chips, boss me-50 all running into, for now, my vox vt20+, which is outputting to my headphones. soooo...Its sounding nicer that way.I cant wait to get it through my other amps.I've also heard of very very short battery life. I've got the standard 9v i think from planet waves and it's powering it just right, so far.Tomorrow's the real test, a few hours at least
