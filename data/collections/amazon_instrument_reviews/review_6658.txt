I swapped out the pickguard on my American Standard to a black one so I figured I'd change the back plate as well. While nobody really sees the back, it drives me nuts when the front and back don't match. Because I didn't want to go without a back plate, as some people like to do, I picked this one up. The holes lined up perfectly and it literally takes less than a minute to install. You can't go wrong with genuine Fender parts.
