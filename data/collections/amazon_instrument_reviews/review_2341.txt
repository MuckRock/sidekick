I hated having to put the pick between strings.  And now that I have a ton of picks, I can convientently put them in this little thing that attaches to the guitar.  Im still weary of putting it on my guitar because it has a matte finish, and I dont want to ruin it.  But the instructions say it should be fine.  I think I might put it on my amplifier instead because having it on the guitar might get in the way as well, still deciding on that.  But for the price you pay for this, it's a no brainer for any musician.
