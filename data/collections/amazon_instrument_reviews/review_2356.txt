I have a black composite acoustic guitar and this little pickholder stays stuck right where the neck meets the body.  People watching me can't really see it, and it's right where I need it, full of picks, if I drop one.  Wonderful little invention.  Buy it, if you don't want to carry a mess of picks in your guitar case or pocket.
