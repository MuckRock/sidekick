In case you were wondering, this is a clone of the Boss compressor/sustainer.  It does a very good job reproducing the original at a fraction of the cost.  You add noise to your chain with any compressor because that's what they do- they elevate quiet signal and minimize volume spikes to even it all out.  When it is off, this thing had pretty decent bypass but I would not string an entire board together with pedals that are not true bypass because it would suck tone.  The box is plastic, but it is solid ABS plastic and is perfectly adequate.  I've not yet heard of a Behringer stomp box failing because the plastic box crushed when someone stepped on it.  People do like to complain about the battery cover being annoying and I have to say- aren't they all??? Seriously- when you can hook up a daisy chain and not ever have to deal with a dead battery ever again in your life, what are you complaining about?  The knobs are solid, and work just fine.  I own like a dozen of these cheap Behringer pedals and I have never had a problem with any of them.  You get more than the asking price worth of function out of this box.
