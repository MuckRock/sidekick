I'm certainly not the musician in the family and honestly know nothing about guitar strings.  I got these for my husband, the aficionado guitar player in the family!  He said these are excellent quality strings and was very happy with the product.  So they come highly recommended from someone who has uttered a swear word or two over inferior strings in the past!  Highly recommended.
