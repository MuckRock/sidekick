When I bought this pedal I was thinking a heavy distortion. But when I got it and played with it I figured out it was alot different that advertised. It is a acdc, Steve Vaughn kind of pedal. It's got an attitude but it soft at the same time. It's truly a one of a kind product. I would recommend this if you are looking for just a basic distortion pedal. Make a note it is not a metal pedal. Not by any means actually. But for what it is it is fantastic.
