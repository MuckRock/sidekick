Great sound, works just like a phaser should. I have had it for a couple months and dig the way it sounds. I use it with very little gain for sort of a clean funky guitar effect. Cool pedal, solid construction. Only thing is that it is big!! One other thing, it works better if you put it in front. I found that in the effects loop, it does not work so great.
