Just put these on my Martin DCX1E and they sound great! This is a big guitar that really rings out and the Elixir strings have a great sparkle with a clear bright tone. Playing rhythm guitar, flat picking and fingerpicking.I can't say if they last longer, vine has us review this asap. After daily playing for hours they sound fine and hold their tuning. I have used Elixir nano web strings before and I do think they keep their tone a bit longer. That being said, my go to strings are still D'addario.
