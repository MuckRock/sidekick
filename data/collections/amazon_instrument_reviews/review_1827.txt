While I love and trust D'Addario strings, i am subtracting one star because, I really like the packaging for other strings when they have individual packets.  For my acoustics, I do not always change out all the strings at once.  I think the bass strings get changed more when they start falling off on sound.Anyway, these are classic strings that I grew up with, but as I get more involved with playing, having the flexibility of individual envelopes for each string becomes more an d more appreciated.  Especially if you like to save your single strings for use.
