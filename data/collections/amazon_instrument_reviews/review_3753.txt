This thing really kicks it up nice and clean or real dirty over the top!I had a LPB1 that sucked tone and sounded like crap but I really need a line boost and didn't want to spend a lot for one.This little baby at about 3 o'clock setting does a real nice job for my solos and louder sections of songs.
