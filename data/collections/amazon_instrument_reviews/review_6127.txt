Just picked up the Korg pitch-black from Guitar Center yesterday. I use a Snark most of the time but i needed something i can tune with during practice while everyone is playing and making noise. love the thing so far. its accurate, fast, fits nicely on my pedal board and its metal not plastic like most tuners for this price. i like the multiple display options and calibrations. Mute function is awesome and true bypass i believe. great buy, i am happy with it. i got it in red.
