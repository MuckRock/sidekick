I almost gave it 4 stars since you have to be smart to assemble it.  Directions don't include the proper details.  I would write them but that's their job.  I spend 20 minutes instead of 5 or so it they explained the process better.  The stand with my guitars looks awesome.  It's perfect for 2-3 acoustics and 1-2 electric guitars.  I wouldn't load it with 7 since they would inevitably bump while putting them in or taking them out.  Nice addition to my studio.
