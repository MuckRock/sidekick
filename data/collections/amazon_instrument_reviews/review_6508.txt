This is a very useful little device. I use this cleaner on my strings after any use of my guitar. It removes anything on the strings and dries them immediately. This will increase the life of your strings. Don't expect miracles, but this helps quite a bit. I have bought this for me and several guitar-playing friends that have found this much useful. Highly recommended. Cheers!
