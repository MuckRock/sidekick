A must for every serious guitar player. This is one of the easiest to use slides that I have ever owned & I have been playing for about 45 years. I play mostly classic rock & this slide is a handy gadget to have in your guitar case.This holds up very well because I have a way of abusing a slide. Dunlop does it again.
