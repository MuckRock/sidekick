I like the overall design of this mount although it would be nice to have a little bit more articulation. The best thing is that I can leave my ipad in the LIFEPROOF case for performances so I don't have to worry about water, sweat, or other various liquids and beverages hurting my main daime, my ipad. I use my ipad for almost everything these days and I certainly can't see going back to a lyric book after using the ipad and the SET LIST MAKER app. Then thes the real book app and of course notes and pages, iBooks, etc. it is a great tool for gigging musicians and this mount gets it up where you can see it. Best thing I've bought for my ipad in a while.
