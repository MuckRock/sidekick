These strings aren't for everyone, and probably not what you want for everyday, normal playing. But if you're looking for a fast-playing string with a bright sound, this is the string. In addition to putting them on my guitar, I also have a six-string banjo (guitar tuning) and just couldn't get the sound I wanted from regular guitar strings. Light guage nickel strings were recommended to me, and they were exactly what I was looking for. They have a clear, bright sound that great for picking and strumming. I play a lot of bluegrass and Irish music, and I feel these strings are ideal for that purpose. I use a lot of D'Addario strings on my various instruments, and I think they offer the most bang-for-the-buck in terms of quality and tone. You can pay more, but I don't think you get that much more. Although these were intended for electric guitar, they also work well on resonator guitars.
