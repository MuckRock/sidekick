Leather type material and corrosive free button type attachment for the strap.  I would prefer it not so wide but you have to include the button.  The button is not a snap, I just lack the word to describe it.  Previously I used to use a shoe lace and I would be thinking about it falling while playing.  Now I have more confidence with this strap.  It's not Gucci but doesn't feel like plastic either.
