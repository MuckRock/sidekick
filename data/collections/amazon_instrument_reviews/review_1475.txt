I read several reviews before purchasing these strings. I've never bought any strings with any sort of coating on them but after putting these on my Yamaha acoustic, it sounded great! They have very good high and low tones and give a more resonating tone to the whole guitar. My Yamaha is not a very expensive model but these strings make it sound like it is. If you're wanting to upgrade to a thicker set of strings, definitely give these a try. The coating is supposed to make them last longer and resist corrosion and what not, but they are also a little smoother on the fingertips when changing chord positions and sliding up and down the fret board.
