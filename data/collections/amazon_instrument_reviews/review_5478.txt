Although not through Amazon.com, I recently purchased a Seagull S6 Original acoustic guitar. I compared this with a variety of other brands in the price range, as well as with the Seagull Entourage acoustic-electric which was also in the general price range.  The S6 has a nicely consistent tone which, although maybe a little too bright for some players' tastes, projects very well.  Some reviewers and guitarists with whom I've talked wonder how Seagull can produce instruments that sound as well as they do in North America for the price.  I think that I found part of the answer when I looked inside some of the Seagulls.  The braces do not look as uniform and neatly finished as they might on other guitars.  Looking at the outside of the guitar and listening to it, though, you'd never know.  I find the 1.8" neck width at the nut to be great for fingerpicking work and left-hand fingering.  It's a compromise between a more standard acoustic neck width and a classical guitar neck width.  For me, it works.  Some players who are more used to a more traditionally narrow neck might not appreciate this attribute of the guitar.  Seagull does offer other models, by the way, that have a more traditional width.  The slightly shorter scale reminds me of the scale Gibson uses on many of its electric guitar models:  just shorter enough to better enable chord fingering, but not so short as to cause floppy strings.  I couldn't be happier with the Seagull S6, especially for the price!
