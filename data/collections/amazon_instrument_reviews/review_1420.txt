What you gain in string life with these strings you loose in tone. I'm not saying the tone is bad, but it's not as good as quality strings with no coat. That having been said, I'm pleased with them as a string for guitar practice. They last for months without a change in tone. I don;t play much in public venues, so it is not a problem for me to change strings when I do.
