I've been using these strings for about eight years, and I also use them on my two Taylor's (814-CE & I use the mediums on my 710) I agree with the other reviewer in saying they are the best sounding coated string out there. I still use Martin strings once in awhile, but these strings last and improve in sound as they get a few hours of play on them.Actually I own three other acoustics other than my two Taylor's and right now they're all strung with EXP's. I know people want different sounds from their strings, but I find these to be bright with a great bottom on them, unlike the Elixirs which I find to be unbearably bright with a weak bottom end. These strings sound great with great dynamics on them. Even on my Laguna Grand Symphony (slightly larger than a Grand Concert) they pump out the lows and sparkle on the highs. These on my Grand Auditorium do the same thing, they produce the sound I demand and make a real positive improvement over the other coated strings I've used.The Mediums on my 710 have an endless bottom end and still have great range on the mid's and treble.As I said I still use Martin Phosphor Bronze strings once in awhile, but honestly these strings hold up extremely well and sound great. Darn near as near to an uncoated string that you're going to find.
