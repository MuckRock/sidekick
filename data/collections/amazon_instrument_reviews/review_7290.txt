I started two years ago with a 15 watt Spider III, then along with other amps, bought a Spider Jam. I thought they were all great.  Now they come out with Spider IV, and the difference in the sound is dramatic.  They are getting very, very close to tube sound.  So much so that for the lousy $299, compared to say $1000+ for 75 watts of tube, this is a real steal.Loaded with features, and hundreds of presets, it has something for everyone. The Pitch Shifter and 18 available manual settings just add to the fun. And it will work with either generation of FBV pedalboard. Says so right in the manual. The only difference I see is with the generation II pedal you get a USB port.Does it sound as creamy and smooth as my Peavey Delta Blues or Crate Palomino tube units?  No, there is still a little digital overlay around in there.  But most people who are looking for a great home based amp, or maybe a church or small gig amp, this is a WINNER and the price is just nuts.  Forget the Peavy Vyper, this is hands down much better and you don't have to sink another couple hundred in a pedal to get to all the presets like the Vyper.
