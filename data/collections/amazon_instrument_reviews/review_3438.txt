But the quality of the sound is not much more than a transistor radio.  There's a slight hiss too.  But I enjoyed listening to it while playing.  And when you attach the headphones it works great.  Amazine that it works off a 9v battery.  Yes, you have to lug around a guitar cord, but what do you expect.  I went all out and got a Roland Cube which should deliver a higher quality sound and has many sound effects.  But that costs 2x or more as much.  I am in the process of returning it.  Look at the picture of it next to a Coke can.  That's what it looks like.  Some people complained that the handle doesn't work.  Who cares.  The tweed on the speaker looks like a toy too.  But that's sort of what you're getting.
