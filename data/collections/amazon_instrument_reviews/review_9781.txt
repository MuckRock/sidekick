This is a very simple product, and, as others have stated, you could probably just 'DIY' one pretty easily....but for this price, why bother??? Under $10 and this thing is as good as ones that range from $20-50.  I don't think the material + the time it is going to take for you to make one (about 30 mins-an hour, more if you have to go out and buy all of the materials) is going to be worthwhile versus just ordering this bad boy online and...voila! It arrives two days later, no fuss no muss (assuming you have Prime, because, well, who doesn't these days? ;) )PLUS this will look good on camera.
