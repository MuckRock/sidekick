I purchased this guitar about a year ago and the thing's still kickin, not planning on replacing it anytime soon.Once I got some new strings put on this beauty sounded like a singing angel, action was fine for me out of the box.Most definitely one of the best &#34;bang-for-your-buck&#34; acoustic guitars.
