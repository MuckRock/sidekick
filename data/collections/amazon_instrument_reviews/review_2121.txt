Folks, I've tried them all from Dean Markley to Ernie Ball.  All have their good and bad points.  But after 22 years of guitar playing, D'Addario still makes the best electric guitar strings for my money.  Although I prefer the super light top, regular bottom version, I have always loved the feel, tone and durability of D'Addario strings.
