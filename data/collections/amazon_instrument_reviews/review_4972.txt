I'm an audiophile, but I've spent most of my adult life looking for outstanding devices that make exquisite sound available to &#34;the rest of us&#34; at realistic prices. The UCA202 is a must-have DAC for anyone streaming or playing digitized music - whether MP3 or 192KBPS FLAC - via a Mac, PC, or Linux computer (especially laptops with notoriously-noisy audio signal pathways).Run your digitized sound through the UCA202, then through a tube buffer stage (for under $100 if you use a pair of Behringer  MIC100s set at unity gain) and then through competent downstream electronics and speakers for &#34;state-of-the-art&#34; at you-and-me prices. Then tell me what YOU think (grin).Or run a pair of &#34;best buy&#34; Sony MDR-7506 headphones (or Direct Sound EX-29s in noisy environments) directly from the the UCA202. Same deal (Laughter of the Immortals).Rest assured I've voted with my feet. I own a total of five UCA202s that I use in different locations. Folks, this is a STELLAR device at a throw-away price. Bravo, Behringer!
