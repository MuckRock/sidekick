Earnie Ball's guitar strap locks are great. in my opinion, the best there way over other brands like Dunlop, Schaller and many others. I have them installed on my Les Paul Axcess and my Jackson Dinky and they are very secure both when rehearsing and gigging. You can definetely trust them to do their job. They also look great. Highly recommended.
