This thing sounds great! I run two outputs from this into my DAW (Reaper), so that I can have a direct DI for reamping and the regular tone from the Hartke's preamp for an overall bass tone. The general sound of it is warm with plenty of low end, and the "Shape" control is pretty cool for adding a little bit of distortion/break-up for layering. It's easy to reamp with, so layering the unshaped Hartke tone + another track of shaped "gritty" tone can get you some seriously solid sounding bass tones in a mix - especially for higher gain metal playing.Awesome unit for the price, very happy with it.
