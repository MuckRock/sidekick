I love the Snark tuners, and I own several different models.  They all work great and of the various models, I prefer the SN-2 (red).  I got the white one because I just liked that it was a unique, Amazon-only model.  The SN-13 display is like the display on the SN-8, and offers lower resolution than the SN-1/SN-2/SN-5 displays.  Still it works beautifully, and the glossy white looks nice clipped on my Pearl White APX700.  Its also easy to find should you drop it in the dark.
