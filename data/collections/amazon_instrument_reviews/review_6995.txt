I'm not a ukulele player, nor do I pretend to be one, but I am guy that likes to make music and I can happily say that the Mahalo U-30GN is a perfect addition to my instrument collection. Worth noting is that you will need to tune the ukulele each time you play for the first few weeks until the strings are &#34;broken in&#34;, but from what I've read and gathered, this is par for the course. Lastly, if you're going to order one, I suggest pairing it with a pack of felt picks. Cheers!
