First real harmonica i have owned. Read all the reviews and this harp was recommended by many. The price is right and the quality seems good too. Didnt take me long to start to pick up some techniques such as bending and single/double blow/draw. Still trying to get the overblow. I am far from perfecting the techniques but this harp is pretty easy to bend notes on. It has a good seal also. Only change i would like is a more rounded shape in the back.
