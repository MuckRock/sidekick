It arrived in a small package with 3 main pieces in it (the base, the bottom fork and the top fork) and it didn't take much assembly to put it together.  It does a great job holding the guitar upright and makes it look a lot nicer as well.  I will probably buy a couple more of these.The only downside I can see so far is that the foam padding is rather thin.  I hope this doesn't eventually have a hole wear through it, but over time I could see it happening.  I suppose by that time I could find some replacement foam and fix it myself though.
