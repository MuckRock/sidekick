You can use a standard eye-glass cleaning cloth (about 2 quid) with this instead of buying a micro-fibre cloth (at 5 quid) they both do the same, imo. You could also use eye-glass cleaning solution instead (which I have in the past) but this special solution works better on the wood and laminate surface of guitars - but not on eye-glasses (smiles). This really does shine up your wood quite well. I recommend.
