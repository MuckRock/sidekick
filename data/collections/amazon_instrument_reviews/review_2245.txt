This is a needed tool when changing strings on guitars especially if you change your stringws often as I do.  I've tried other types including those that I made myself but I much prefer this one.  I find it ight and solid and cradels well the nect of any of my guitars...from Fender, Takamine, Ovations...etc. For the cost it is worth it and can easily take it with you in your guitar case when travelling. Highly recommended.
