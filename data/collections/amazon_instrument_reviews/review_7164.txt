I bought 4 pcs of these at $8each shipped. These are very well constructed and function very well too. I am using these to tap the INSERTS from my mixer and send the signal to my M-audio Fast Track ultra for recording. By putting the 1/4" TS partially in to the INSERT of my mixer (and most mixers) you can get a direct output without actually interupting the signal chain. The other end of the 1/4" TS cable goes to the PDC21 and then I use the XLR output to connect to my Fast Track using either and XLR to XLR or and XLR to TRS cable. My Fast Track did not like something about the signal level when I fed it directly from the mixer but with the PDC21 between the mixer and FTU, it works fantastic. This is for refernce recording in our jam-space, not studio recording; it works great for this application.I have also used this as a DI box for guitar, all of my gear is middle of the line (not junk but not super high-end), I don't notice any tone-sucking in my "jam-space" application.I would definately buy more.
