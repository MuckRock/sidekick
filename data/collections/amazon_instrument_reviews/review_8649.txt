It does what is supposed to, i'ts a gate, and clamps the noise as good as I expected, at the begining I had problems with power, some how it didn't power correctly, but I was unsing one spot adapter and a daisy chain, so I solved it isolating the MXR connecting it with another power supply, and it work, so I left my daisy chain with the rest of my pedals and it worked just fine, also check config and the routing of the signal, this might influence on how it works, I have it right after my Wha and before my compressor, and it works just fine.
