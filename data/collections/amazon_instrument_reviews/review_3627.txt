Well, I ordered 2 sets of these, and 2 sets of medium strings when I got my first banjo, as I didn't know what gauge strings I would prefer. So far I like the light strings better for clawhammer, which is mostly what I play. Easy on the fingers and sound good, to my ears at least...Not much else to say about strings :P. Would recommend them.
