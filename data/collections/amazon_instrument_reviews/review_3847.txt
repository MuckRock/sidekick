They call these mini tuners, but to me they are just right. Some tuners are too big and bulky looking imho. I installed them on a PRS SE Santana in just a few minutes. They were direct drop ins. To use them you simply grab the top and turn it until it clicks. Then you line the hole up with the center of the headstock, insert the string and then turn the tuning peg. You'll feel it &#34;lock in&#34; then about another quarter turn and the string is in tune. They are really good tuners and I think anyone will be pleased with the tuning stability they offer.
