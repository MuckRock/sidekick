Don't expect it to sound like a regular guitar and you won't be disappointed. That said, I find it useful for composing on the road. Heck, it even sounds better than my big guitars, in an odd way, for certain songs. Nice sturdy and portable case. Not good for overheads in airplanes because it takes up space for several bags, but flight attendants will usually store it in the locker up front if you ask. Action is adequate for practice--with a little tweaking it's actually good. Quiet enough to play in your hotel room and not disturb your neighbors.
