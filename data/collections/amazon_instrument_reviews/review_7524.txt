I really enjoyed this tuner, extremely fast an accurate at tracking you. I've been surching for a decent tuner for about a few months now and I've demoed the pitchblack and the planet waves tuner, all never could track me as well as the TU-3 could! What I mean by tracking me, I'm talking about how fast it can respond to me changing the pitch. Its a great tuner, a little pricy, but worth it in the long run... I was even surprised they included a battery!
