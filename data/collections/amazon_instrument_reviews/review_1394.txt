I bought my new guitar and wanted to keep it in great shape.  I guess this kit works okay, but it's hard to use.  It will probably last my entire lifetime.  I think a smaller kit would have been better.  You really need to remove the strings when you use it, so you have to take off all the strings.  I usually only replace one string at a time when I am changing strings, so I had to change my habits.  If you have a guitar without a truss rod, that may mean you will take a lot more time tuning after you're done changing the strings, since the neck will bend more as you tighten the strings one at a time, and that will change the pitch of the strings you have already tuned.  I'm no expert, but I have a gut feeling that this was not money well spent.  However, since I love my guitar, I use it anyway.
