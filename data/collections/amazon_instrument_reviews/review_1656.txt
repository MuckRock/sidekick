Not that it's a huge deal - but I quite prefer this capo over any other capo I've used.  It just has the most solid build quality and the simple pull style of loosening and tightening works better and more quickly than the type that "snap" into place.I own several of these now and whenever I mis-place one (which happens too often!) I come back to purchase another.If you're looking for a capo I highly recommend using this Dunlop model.
