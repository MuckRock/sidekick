This tuner works really well, i bought one a few months ago and it's super precise. I had it for a few months before I put it in my pocket and bumped into a wall and the socket snapped. It still worked really well but i needed a lot of duct tape to hold it together. 4 of my friends have had this same problem more than once, but we were all not too careful with it, if you don't bang it around it's great, i bought a new one
