Having 250 feet of xlr - xlr (m-f) cables that can be used any way I want (e.g. 2 ea 125 foot for stereo, 1 250 foot for mono, or 10 ea 25 foot for multichannel work) is very flexible.The packaging on these was also well done with a ziploc type bag and a velcro reusable wrap on each cord (white) to store them when not in use.As all of my sound equip is xlr or speakon connectors, this worked great for a recent outdoor dj job.  I ended up using all 10 of the 25' cords for mics and amplified speakers, plus another 6 of their 3 foot cables for interconnect.  You can never have enough xlr cables or adapters!
