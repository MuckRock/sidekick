I have owned this guitar for about 2 years now, and it still has a great sound and is very playable, especially for the money. It stays in tune very well even though the tuners do seem a little cheaper than Epiphones I've owned in the past... but hey, they work so why change them? The overall fit and finish of the guitar is excellent for the price point, and mine has the flat black finish which hides fingerprints very well. The neck is fast and smooth and great for quick playing. The single coil p90 style pickups on this guitar scream with their own beautiful raw sound, and were the reason I bought this guitar. Take note that p90's do make a humming sound when you're not playing, which can be remedied by turning down the volume knob. This is why humbucker style pickups were invented, but the compromise of a humbucker is you lose a lot of the bite and energy that p90's give you. It really has the sound of a higher dollar guitar. I currently play it through a Fender Vibro Champ tube amp and this combo really makes playing guitar fun. I recommend this guitar if you're on a budget like me, or even if you're not on a budget and want a p90 equipped guitar in your stable.
