These aren't usually my go-to strings, but D'Addarios are a good, solid sounding string. They last fairly long when taken care of, and don't usually break too often. I DO like that they sound kind of bright without being overbearing. They will continue to be my 2nd string of choice, as they've not failed me any time I've purchased them. Definitely recommended.
