These are great guitar strings and are all that guitarists say they are. They are so tuneful, they make an ordinary acoustic guitar sound beautiful. My only concern is that if the strings aren't wound properly they seem brittle and break. e.g. Low E and A strings and the vulnerable G string.The LIGHT version I find, are particularly suited to finger picking.
