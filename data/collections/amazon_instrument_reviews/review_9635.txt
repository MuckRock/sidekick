kripes man..the one time I go and actually buy a "honer" and its a "bummer" this thing has 3 keys off tune!! I can buy stuff 10 times better quality from Chinaand never have this kinda junk. Maybe it's a fluke because everyone else gave it a thumbs up and I 'm really not the type a guy to go running stuff down butmaaan Ive never got a harp this trashy B4!...... all i can say is buy Merana's for tryin out buy "suzuki" or Swan" from ebay/overseas if yer a poor guy like meand you'll be better off. Oh btw hot-tip for poor guys again--- you can get a "Mississipi River Harp" for only  $5.oo if you have a "Burke's" outlet near you!they're up by the counter and as good as the high dollar one made by unowho---- the Doctah has spoken! :)
