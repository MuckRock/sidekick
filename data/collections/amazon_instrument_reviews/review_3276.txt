These are the standard in guitar strings - they are well made, play nicely and are the size that most guitars come with from the factory.Do they have every bell and whistle modern strings come with? Are they hand-wound? Are they made with exotic materials? No to all the above. These are a high quality no-frills set that is acceptable to everyone from beginners to the most accomplished professional.These days they make everything from coated strings of various colors, to pure nickel to pure stainless steel in almost every mix and match gauge imaginable. If you aren't a beginning guitarist you probably aren't reading this review, because you've already played a set of these. You are off playing different brands and tech just to fine tune things, maybe trying out the latest coating or maybe just deciding that pure nickels have that vintage vibe you're going for.But if you just need to know if Ernie Ball strings are any good they are. The bigger question for beginners is do I keep the gauge that came on my instrument, (these for Gisbsons, Super Slinkys - pink package - for Fenders as a rule of thumb) or do I try something new.In summary, for me these are the safe pick, the strings that I know will work when I just need a good set of strings at a great price. You really can't go wrong with a set of these.
