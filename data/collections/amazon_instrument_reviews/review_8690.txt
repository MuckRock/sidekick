The Planet Waves Guitar Rest works for ukuleles!  I just got one, and have used it for a few days, and it's the bomb!  I can set my little ukuleles down now without fear of falling over.  This product is a rubber disc with small "arms" in a gentle curve that nestles against the edge of any surface, and you can set your instrument against it, and voila, it doesn't fall over!  Here at home, I use it on the second shelf of a bookcase, and my concert sized ukulele fits like a glove, heel on carpet, neck in Guitar Rest.I'm going to buy a couple more for my ukulele cases, because I can use them at one of my uke parties.  If one sets a tiny ukulele on the floor, for instance, to take a whizz, they're just small enough to go unseen and have someone step on them.  Here, I just find a spot near wherever I'm sitting, and it becomes my "lean" spot, and I can even set my beer can on the round part on the back!  Coaster uke/guitar holder.  It's quite immovable once it has some weight against it from the instrument.  I could carry a metal stand with me, but it wouldn't fit in my ukulele case--this Planet Waves product does.  A winner.
