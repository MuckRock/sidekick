First off this costs extra because of the drum pads which are pretty much useless. You have to practically hit them with a hammer to get a response. The keyboard feel flimsy and they are indeed small and not very playable. There is no modulation wheel but you do get crappy unresponsive pads and cheap knobs. HATE the mini USB jack since those connections rarely last. For this price it is a 'Do Not Recommend' for me.
