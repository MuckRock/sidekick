the snark series of tuners are the best small tuners I have found, I have both the the SN-1 and SN-2 for my guitar and mandolin respectively, when buying be sure to get the correct one for the instrument you are going to use it on, if not sure which, get the SN-2 (red) one it generally will work for all instruments.
