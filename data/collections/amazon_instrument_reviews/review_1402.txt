I have used Ernie Ball strings for along time.  Mostly slinky's or super slinky's.  I read the review on these and thought I would give these a try for the sound they make paired with a LP.I bought these to replace the stockers on the EPI LP 100 I just bought.  Luckily I order two packs.  I was putting on the top E string and had turned the crank less than a few times, not near enough tension on the string yet to even be in tune yet, and "pop" it broke. I had ordered two sets, so I put on the one from the new set. No problems until I got to the G string, then "pop" another breaker. Very sad quality.After finally getting them on and in tune (you will need to stretch the top 3 strings alot to get them to stay in tune, especially the E) I have to say they have a great sound to them.  Nice tone and sustain.  Great crucnhy sound for metal, but still a good clean tone too.  These are thick strings, but still bendable, just not very far.  I would rate the sound 5 stars.Unfortunately, it takes two packs of strings for one successful stringing to occur because of how brittle the strings are.  So I have to give these three stars overall.
