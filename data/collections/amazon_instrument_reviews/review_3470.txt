They were a little too much for the Squier Bullet I put them on, even with the truss rod maxed out they bowed the neck.While I had em on though they played well and bent relatively easy for their thickness. More metal moving over a guitar pickup = hotter sound, more gain, and on a Stratocaster more glass and bell like tones.I've used Ernie Ball's Slinky line of strings almost exclusively for decades. They never break, they stay in tune after stretching, and they sound great. Lots of harmonics make for a textured and musical sound.Fun fact: Get yourself a mandrel for sizing rings and you can turn your old guitar strings into custom made jewlery. There is something to be said for giving a pretty ring that used to make a pretty sound RINGing out of your amplifier. :) A little silver lead free solder to hold several windings together and then buffed and they look excellent. :)
