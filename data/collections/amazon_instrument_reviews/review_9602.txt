I've used this tuner for both my acoustic guitar and banjo for a year now and like them a lot.  We got this one for my wife's mandolin.  It's small, barely noticeable from the front and easily visible from the back.  I understand it can be a tight fit on some headstocks, it's snug on my 12 fret slot-head guitar due to the buttons pointing straight down but it works ok for me.  The accuracy is as good or better than any I've used.Pros:AccurateCheapEasy to see in daylight or darkGood battery lifeIt's always there, you don't have to hunt for a tuner.Cons:I wish it would turn the tuner buttons for me!
