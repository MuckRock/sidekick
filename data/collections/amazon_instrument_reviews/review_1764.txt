I've had one of these for about 20 years, have gigged with it extensively, and I've only had to replace it once. (more on that later).I'm not really a cork-sniffer re: guitar tone.  I think most of our tone comes from our fingers, and so the trend in the last several years toward high dollar guitar cables is lost on me.  I think this Monster cable sounds fine.  Better?  Well, better than what?  I don't really notice a difference when I use different cables.  Maybe a slight difference in the high frequencies, but it's so slight as to be negligible.I look for guitar cables that will last.  That's what I really care about, and so far this Monster cable does the trick.  I use other brands, too - this is my most expensive cable but I think it was worth the $40 I spent all those years ago.Oh, and the return process.  This was maybe 10 years ago.  I called Monster, they gave me their address and I had to pay about $3 to ship it back to them.  About 2 weeks later I had a new cable.  I consider that to be excellent customer service.
