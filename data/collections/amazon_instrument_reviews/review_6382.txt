This had to be designed by someone who understood the need for well-placed lighting for those who need to read sheet music while performing. the flexible necks allow you to quickly twist and aim the light 'just right' over two open pages. The battery operation is nice if you want to be portable, but I have found that the AC adapter (Mine came with the light, check to be sure you get one with yours) is the way to go if you have a piano or keyboard in place where you practice every day. My Duracell batteries ran down quickly, over a few weeks before I noticed the light becoming slightly less and less. The AC adapter keeps the power flowing and the lights at full brightness. The whole unit is light enough to clip onto a music stand back or to a music book that you place other sheet music in front of. I needed to buy an extension cord as the AC adapter cord is only about 6 feet long, and while that sounds like a lot, by the time you lay it out where you want it (out of the way to avoid tripping) you might need to add an extension cord too. I understand the LED's themselves last a long long time, so that is good, they operate at a very cool low temperature so no hazard there. All in all, these do the job, illuminating with a pleasant easy to read-by light.
