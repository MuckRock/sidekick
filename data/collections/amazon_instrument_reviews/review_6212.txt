These cables are made from top quality components and expertly assembled in the USA.  I had one just like this with the Neutrik connectors (gave away as gift) and now have two with the G&H; Show Saver connector option.  This makes them similar to some boutique cables that cost three times the price.These cables are well-balanced with articulate mids and highs and tight bass.  They are well-shielded, look nice, and handle well.You could pay more for gold plating for slightly better corrosion resistance or for woven coverings to make the wire look cute, if you want to.
