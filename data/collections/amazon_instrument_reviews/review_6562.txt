I usually use fender .73 picks but they seemed to fall out of my fingers while I was playing and it was very irratating. So I picked these up. I no longer have to worry about them falling out of my hand. The star in the middle allows your fingers to connect in the star and you are able to get a good and stable grip on it. Hands down the best pick I've used.
