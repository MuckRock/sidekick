Nice little kit. it has 800 grit sandpaper in it, I hadn't noticed that in the listing, maybe I overlooked it. I had just bought some 600 grit at homedepot and used on the neck of a used guitar that had been neglected for nearly a decade. The 600 made it glassy smooth again (wet sanding) - I used this instead of the 800 that came with the package and it worked well for me.I had made the mistake of waxing my fretboard with carnuba wax after reading about it on a chat board. Big mistake it deadened the sound terrible. I was miserable, my guitar sounded like s***.After 20 minutes with this kit and a new set of strings and Bob's your uncle, good as new. I'm going to use this everytime I change strings on all my guitars.Nice little kit, I might even get around to using the 800 grit paper that came with it one of these days. Works a charm on acoustic guitars, haven't tried it on the electric guitars yet.
