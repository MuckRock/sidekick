I have at least 5 of these. I like the small footprint, plus it collapses for flat storage or transport. Holds acoustic or electric. Good quality, stable, economical. I have read that the foam padding can react with nitrocellulose lacquer and mar the instruments finish. I haven't seen that on my older stands, but to error on the side of caution, I have glued thin leather to the back and lower support of the stands. It is working fine. I bought the first about 10 years ago. It is still like new.
