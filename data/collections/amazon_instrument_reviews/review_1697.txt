These picks far exceed my expectations, I mean how good could a pick be anyway?  These are the classiest, nicest looking picks I own.  They look great, feel great and play great.  Call me a snob, but I wanted these to match my Fender Stratocaster.  Kind of like using a GM part on my 68 Chevelle..If you own a Fender and want to spend just a few bucks for a &#34;feel good&#34; gift to yourself, buy these.I love the color and texture too, they don't slip or move around as you play.
