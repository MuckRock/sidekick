Look no further...You will not be let down by the build quality of these cables nor by the sound quality. I have a Monster M ROCK-12 cable. Put up against these, I fail to distinguish the difference in sound. The only difference? Price. These cables are the ONLY cable I will ever use from now on. Go ahead, buy them. You will love them.
