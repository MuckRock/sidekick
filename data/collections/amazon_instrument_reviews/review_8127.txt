...even a kid can use it with a guitar. I received 2 in a kool metallic-blue, but as far as I know you can't choose the color and it is bad because a match with the instrument is kool.My perplexity (this is why the 4 stars) is generally on electronic tuning, it happened to me that different brands gave a slight different tune, while 'all' should be perfect and perfectly the same... creepy isn't it?What we do now?  I do not own a grand piano to decide which is the right tune ...better go back to the diapason?
