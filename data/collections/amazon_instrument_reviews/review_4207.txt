i knew it would be small but i wasn't thinking this small, ,it shore is cute,, good enough for now ,but not for the long-run,, shore its loud for the size but, it rattles when you turn it up and amps slides  from vibration,,if you keep it on lower sound its fine, this is only for temporary use for me. its an ok tiny mini little amp  (for it's size its good,) don't exspect a fender amp thats all,
