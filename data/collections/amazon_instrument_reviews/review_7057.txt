run this into my laptop from a behringer 1202fx mixer. windows 7 didnt need to install any drivers,it was plug n play. reaper picks it up immediately, just arm the track, set level and record. I will offer thistid bit of information because i had the problem where very little signal from the mixer and uca 222 into reaperhad the track peaking out and distorting. I found that others had the same issue. I had to right click on the volumespeaker in the bottom right on the task bar of my computer, click "recording devices", select my uca222 (not internal microphone) from the list,click "properties" at the bottom of the Sound window, select the "levels" tab and reduce the level to around 2 or 3 to have an equal volume from themixer into windows 7 and Reaper. Until i did that, every signal into Reaper was too hot and would distort even if the mixer output was set to next to nothing.I tried everything in reaper to resolve the issue until i finally did a search for others having the same problem.So far the behringer uca 222 is working great. and signal is clean.
