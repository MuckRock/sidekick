This is a great capo!  I had been using Kyser Quik-Change capos for a good portion of my ten years of playing but they had their limits.  For one, intonation wasn't always right and my guitar (especially my electric) would go out of tune frequently.  After trying others, I settled on the Shubb and it outguns the Kyser in every aspect.  Its features surprised me.  It is small and incredibly light weight, you almost can't tell that it's there. The adjustable knob is great and allows you to dial the capo to the right pressure so that you don't get any annoying buzz.  Also my tone has greatly improved (which is an awesome bonus) making my acoustic sound much clearer and much more defined as opposed to the Kyser which I noticed muddied up the sound.  Even though you have to make some adjustments this capo is still easy to use and is one of the best investments I have ever made!
