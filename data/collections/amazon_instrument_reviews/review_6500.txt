if you can drill into wood with a 5/8 wood drill bit then these are for you, I bought mine for an amp 1/4 stack and now when I record I can simple roll the head and Cabinet into the small room and record...you get 4 in the package with 4 wheels and 4 retainers thats 5/8&#34; thick that goes into the wood of a cabinet....
