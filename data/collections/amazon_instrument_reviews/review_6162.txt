I have a LOT of pedals.... including many delays and echos...The MXR is just little more organic and warm in tone and response then my Aqua Puss, EH Delux Memory Boy, Ibanez, Boss, and lets not even get into the Behringer stuff...  :)I like the chorus-like mod button.  Very lush and sweet to listen too.  Not as feature rich as some of my other delays, but a tad more appealing to the ear then the others to me.  Simple to use, compact and well built.  I like using this clean... but even it's ability to take some distortion is pretty good.This is simliar to my favorite echo (the Morely ECV from the 70's) in that is has that real warm surrounding sound to it.  Lush is the right word.Hope this helps.
