This is one of those simple gizmos that make you wonder "why didn't i think of that", it snaps around my mandolin strings by the bridge and a quick run up to the nut and back down  every few weeks keeps the strings clean, and best of all I don't find lint from my cleaning rag in the wound strings any more since I started using this instead of the cheesecloth I used to use.
