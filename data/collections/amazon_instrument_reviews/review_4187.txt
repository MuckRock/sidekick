I've had this stand for about 5 years and have used it on stage for the last 3 years pretty steady.  The first thing that broke was the piece that keeps that upper shaft from pulling all the way out of the base when you extend it - the disclaimer here is that it was very cold and I immediately extended it to the maximum point always letting it hit the collar to stop it. It's plastic; Plastic and cold don't mix - The retainer piece broke and went flying and I was standing there with my guitar stand in two pieces right before a gig.  I managed to get it back together but now I have to be very careful when extending the neck. The other part that I've been having problems with is the upper collar that mounts to the top of the stand and holds the guitar necks.  It has come up completely off and I must continually tighten that hex screw to prevent the top from falling off.  I won't mark this stand less then 4 stars even with those issues because it really is a great stand.  Another person noted to pay attention to your guitar dimensions, which is very good advice.  Long bass guitars end up resting on the bottom leg of the tripod.
