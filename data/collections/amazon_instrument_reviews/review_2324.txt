I love this little item.  I was reluctant sticking anything on my nice new Fender but I love it.  No more hunting for picks anymore.  When I am through playing a just slide my pick back into the holder and it's always there when I pick up the guitar.Placement is everything though so think it out before you just stick in on your guitar.  I placed mine where I'd never rub against it, between the amp cord inlet and a control knob.  Make sure it isn't in the way of your strumming or any place your body will rub against it.I love this and have one coming for my acoustic too, only it is the wood grain version to match the wood on the guitar.Oh, I use medium picks and fit 7 easily into the holder and wouldn't try to squeeze another on in, but that's why you have a gig bag anyway.  This is a must have item, in my opinion.
