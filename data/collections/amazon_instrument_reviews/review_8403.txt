these are great for people when practicing they are cheap and sound good.they are almost as good sounding as monster cables but just a little bit worse. i actually dont use monster cables anymore i like this one more and for the price how can i complain.a tip for people new to guitar, cable that have a angled jack are best for when you sit and play because when you plug a straight one into the guitar jack and you sit you actually bend the wire, and what happens is the wire actually have to be bent in a certain way to work and eventually wont work at all,just like headphone wires.but when you plugged the angled one into the guitar its all good and no problems.
