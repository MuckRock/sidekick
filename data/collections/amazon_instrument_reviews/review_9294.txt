This thing sounds amazing- except for one small problem: At higher gain settings it hisses like a mother. I'm not talking about extreme settings, just gain and &#34;character&#34; (thats what Tech 21calls it- forgot what Joyo calls it) at 3 o'clock. It has a beautiful WARM singing lead tone-better than any pedal that I have owned ( and that's probably 20-30 distortion/overdrive pedals) If only it didn't hiss so much it would be my main lead pedal. If you have a Rocktron Hush or other noise gate pedal, it is worth considering. The Joyo is an EXACT clone of the Tech 21British pedal, which costs $189 (?). I don't know it the tech 21 has the same hissing problem or not.
