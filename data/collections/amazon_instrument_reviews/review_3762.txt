I really like it!!!!!  You have to have a Levy's strap to use this but since they are the most durable and comfortable I already own two of them. I never have to worry about the transmitter hitting the floor. I check the battery level when I am not playing, the strap goes over the leds, but that is a minor issue. Most good wireless transmitters only use one or two batteries. I always use new ones so I know I have way more juice then I need for my practice or whatever.This is very ruggedly made I think it will last for ever.
