This Jim Dunlop 210 Dunlop Bottleneck Slide is basically a glass tube and so far seems pretty durable.  I will not get it to describing this specific product in detail because, well, its just a tube.  I think I already mentioned something about it being sturdy.A bottleneck slide is always nice to have one to replicate someone else's guitar sound or create your own.  Whether you get brass or glass is your preference.  Yes, they do have different tonal qualities, so you may want to try or buy both.Happy playing.  Cheers!~J
