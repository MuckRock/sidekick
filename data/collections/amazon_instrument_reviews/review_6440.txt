Over the years, I've literally owned dozens of electronic tuners...generally five or six at a time in various locations...ranging from a $12 Musiciansfriend promotional item to a $200 rack mount. Most have been in the $30 range from Sabine, Yamaha, Korg, and Seiko. The Seiko SAT800E is my all time favorite because, like Mama Bear in the fairy tale, it affordably splits the difference between "too small" and "too big". It stays put on the floor when I run it inline between my guitar/bass/uke and my amp and its LCD display is large enough to be legible when I'm standing. At the same time, it neatly fits in my ukulele case. Beyond that, it simply does what good electronic tuners do, accurately and without fanfare. Bravo.
