So far still Made in America. I have been using formula 65 guitar polish for over 40 years since a time when my hair was longer as a hippie growing up with heavy metal. I've polished many guitars multiple times. This gets the grime and fingerprints off the body and neck keeping the instrument looking like new. It works great on acoustic and electric, solid or hollow body, acrylic or lacquer finishes without streaking. It even cleans Finger Ease lubricants off the neck and strings. I haven't needed other products separately for the neck or strings since this works great on both.
