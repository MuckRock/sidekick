I ordered two sets so that I could set everything up in nice orderly progression on my stomp box.  Heard no evidence of hum and they seem to work just fine keeping everything in order!By the way, these are listed as  .5 feet (6"), but actually are 10".  Wish I had measured as I ordered a 12" long cords thinking they would be twice as long.  Oooops, my bad when I discovered they were only 2" longer!
