Almost a perfect pic for me. I use a .73mm. Just wish it was more like a fender pic finish...that being fender seems to stick to your fingers better. This pic seems to have a coating that makes is slightly softer to the touch or something.  Still prefer this pic to the fender because this one holds up much much better- in comparison to fender mediums.
