Excelent product, great quality and useful in many different ways, I specially use it for looping and create new options for soloing, since it can record up to 40 seconds and it will not end unless you stop it, this is a great tool for experimenting with all your rythms and solos, I also have it connected in a FXs loop with the Mustang fender IV, and it works just perfect in stereo mode, the reverse mode rocks, allows you to do great fading delay violing efect, this is simply the best pedal I got since it's so versatile, I do play Metalcore and alt rock most of all and it works like a champ!! Love it
