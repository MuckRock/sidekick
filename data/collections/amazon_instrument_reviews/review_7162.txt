This passive DI-box is a great little tool that provides attenuation to interface a line or instrument output with a balanced microphone input.  Some notes on this box are that the 0db attenuation still has some attenuation.  The -20db attenuation sounded funny, but that is probably because I used the same equipment for all attenuation settings.  With each attenuation setting, I had to adjust the input volume accordingly.  This device also a some ground lift switch that can prevent ground loops.  All the devices that I tried this with did not have their own internal grounding, so I needed to have the ground come from the mixer.  I did get some hum when I would touch the case, just like I did with other DI-boxes.  This product worked very well for my needs.
