My old pair of JBL Studio Pro computer monitors finally gave up the ghost. At the time, mid 1990's, these were the best you could expect for computer monitors. I do mixing and voice overs, so I needed the real deal. After extensive research and listening, I decided on the M-Audio BX5a deluxe. For the price they can not be beat! Punchy crisp bass, smooth highs and great mid range. They are also very accurate, I hear things just the way they are recorded. They also bring to light subtleties in old CD's that I have never heard before! Also the wood construction, gives these speakers a warmer resonance than others made out of plastic or metal. If you have a studio on a budget, and need the best speakers for under $500.00, buy these. Remember, they are studio monitors, so the audio is going to be very directional, so use them for monitors. Great speakers for portables, like an Ipod. One note, you need a really good sound card to get the most from these babies!
