Make sure you read the description of the color you are choosing. Most of them are plastic.I bought the ebony with pearly inlay. They look great, it is, indeed, real ebony with a pearl inlay.The pins are sort of an odd size (not sure if there is a generic pin size...), so they might work, and they might not. They fit one of mine perfectly, and another, not very well. I would assume they fit all Martin guitars well, because my experience with Martin is that their instruments are pretty similarly made in way of parts and quality.Overall, great bridge pins for the price, and they sounds much better than plastic ones!
