It fits my acoustic well while giving minimum protection.Storage compartment could be larger, but good for extra strings and picks.You can&#8217;t fit a full sheet of paper or an 8.5&#8221; x 11&#8221;paper back guitar book in the zipper compartment.I would be careful of putting anything in the zipper compartment that could damage the guitarCross straps work well for carrying. Zipper system works well.It is a nice acoustic guitar bag for an inexpensive guitar considering the price.It fits my Jasmine ES31C Dreadnought Acoustic-Electric Guitar just fine.You really can't beat it for the price.
