Wow.  I have been impressed with a lot of Joyo's products, but their Sweet Baby Overdrive was one that came highly recommended, and hasn't disappointed.  I held off a little bit until the price came down, but the truth is that this thing is worth every penny it's sold for, and then some.As the description says, this is a "mild overdrive".  It won't give you the "Brown Sound".  It's not meant for metal.  It's almost like adding a tube-amp "gain" knob to your existing rig, add subtle yet dynamic saturation and sustain to an otherwise clean tone.  Chords and notes blend together beautifully without crunching up or fizzing out.  Unlike many "tube" overdrive pedals, this thing has tons of volume on tap.  You can set the "Drive" to 0 and still have a nice loud clean boost.  Turn up the drive and it can do blues and rock.  But I think of it more as an enhancement to your clean tone, as opposed to an "effect" that transforms it.  In that respect, it actually reminds me of the BOSS OD-3 Overdrive, which is a vastly underrated pedal (though the OD-3 probably offers more gain).The Focus knob is interesting - it doesn't act exactly like a tone knob.  As you turn it up, it doesn't remove bass, but changes the gain structure a little and opens up the tone.  The lower settings are bluesy - the higher settings are bright and dynamic.  But chances are, both will sound good.There are some concerns you could have about the build quality - the switch may not be built to last 20 years, and having to remove 4 screws to get to the 9V jack is annoying.  I also wish they'd put the 9V adapter jack on top instead of the side.  But those are mostly minor gripes.  It's an excellent overdrive and an incredible value.
