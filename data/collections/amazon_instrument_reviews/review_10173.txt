I am a guitar player who bought a drum kit for people to jam on when they are at my place. I also bought a lesson book for drums, for myself. I point this out so you know &#34;who&#34; is writing the review; a rookie drummer...I did some research before buying and found most if any negative comments were along the lines of &#34;if you tune your drums properly...these aren't needed&#34;. Well, news flash, I'm not a freaking drummer or expert drum technician with years of experience. I can tune them half decent with the torque tuner I bought (Rhythm Tech RT 7350 ) but there are several drums that still had overtones or prolonged sustain that I did not like in my tiny jam room.This moongel was so simple to apply it is a crime and I just moved them around a little to get them in a position that was both out of the way and killed the resonation I wasnt liking. So what's not to like? I love it!Cost wise, Amazon was a few $$ more than the local GC but then again, it was quick and simple.I liked it so much I bought a second.
