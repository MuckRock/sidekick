The adjustment screw/handle bit still works after 2 years, and the base is heavy- a cast metal.They look good and the paint lasts- great for a performance space.Now about the title- I used one (I own 2) as a sledge hammer during a band bonding event. The base ended up striking the concrete patio, and a chunk of the base broke off. Not a issue with manufacturer, but don't drop it too hard. Despite the break, the stand still sits upright, and i still use it.nice and cheap.
