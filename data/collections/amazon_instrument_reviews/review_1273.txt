You need nothing else to replace your string, no matter if you have an acoustic or a electric guitar, or both. I have a couple of acoustics and electrics and you can remove the retainers of the acoustic guitars without doing damage. is fast to tight up the string and it has a cutter if you (like me) don't like the extra hanging from the guitar like cat mustache.Recomended!
