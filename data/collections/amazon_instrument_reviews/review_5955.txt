For the money (CHEAP!), this is worth getting. The loop feature is quite good, the delay/echo entirely satisfactory. Not as good as, say, a BOSS unit, but they cost 5x as much. Great for everything from slapback to long delay, with heap-big repeats available. The plastic housing might not stand-up to the road. Having the 9v adapter input on the side behind the in jack, rather than the back, seems wise. I've read some negative press about Behringer pedals, but personally cannot complain.
