With musical instruments standing about on my office floor, I determined to find a better way to keep them available, and so I decided to hang them on the walls. This hanger was very easy to install. It comes with screws and anchors so that it can be attached to drywall itself, or through drywall and into wall studs. I used the pre-drilled holes as a template to mark my wall and the hanger went in easily. But a word of warning: use a level to align the hanger to a vertical position on your wall. If you don't, your guitar will hang a bit cock-eyed.
