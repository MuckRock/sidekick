At first it seemed stupid to buy wire cutters just for guitar strings, but these do work extremely well.  They seem to be very high quality and easily clip guitar strings right to the tuner post.I do agree with the other user who pointed out the fact that they're spring loaded open with no mechanism to keep them closed.  That does make storing them a little akward, but again, I think this is the best product out there if you change your own strings.PS - If you are using scissors to clip strings ends, you are crazy - buy these things...
