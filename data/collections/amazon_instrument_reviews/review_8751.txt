I couldn't believe that a hardshell mandolin case even existed for this price. Especially given what I paid for it, this case is unbelievable... velvety cushioning inside, heavy-duty outside, and a little compartment for picks or capos (I can't fit much else in there but I don't really need to). A few other reviewers have mentioned that it can be a squeeze -- at first, I didn't think my Ibanez mandolin fit in here, but when I finally applied some pressure, it went right in. Now that I've been using the case for a while it seems broken in, and I don't have to fight it so much to get it to close.The only downside is that after a few uses, the outer black layer of the case started peeling off at the edge. I used some electrical tape to stick it back on there and since it's on the bottom, it's not very noticeable, but that was the one place where the low price kind of showed through. I didn't take a star away for that as it's purely cosmetic, and as long as this thing is protecting my mandolin, I can forgive some tape on the edge. In this case, I still got more than my money's worth.
