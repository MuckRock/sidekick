Hold a tune very well, and sound good. The seem to have a bit less tension than other brands strings of the same gauge, but thats ok.If you dont wipe them off after playing, they wont last long. But I always do, and I change strings often, so that isnt an issue for me.Overall, some of the best strings available.
