I was at Guitar Center looking for the right gig bag for my recently purchased Ibanez EW20ASENT Acoustic Guitar, which is virtually identical to theIbanez EW20ZWENT Exotic Woods Series Zebrawood Acoustic Electric Cutaway Guitar, but everything they had in stock was a bit too small... I've been playing electric for many years, but this was my first acoustic purchase. Turns out I have the "Dreadnought" variety, which is a bit larger. This Fender bag received some great reviews, but I was apprehensive about having to return it if the dimensions weren't correct... I couldn't find ANY info on the web about the interior dimensions of this bag, so I took the leap... and I'm so glad I did! Bag is not too snug, not too loose, and has a great array of zippered pockets and dual shoulder straps. Great padding, yet still lightweight. And a great price! And it arrived a day early... sweet. Ibanez EW20 body (not neck) dimensions: W 16", D 5", L 20". Thank you Amazon & Fender!
