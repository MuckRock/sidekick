These strings sound great on an acoustic when properly tuned, I bought these at a local shop after looking at a different brand. The owner of the shop reccomended them as part of a setup. I like the lighter sounds out of them, and using a capo makes them sound great also. These seem significantly brighter and more dynamic than my previous set of Ernie Ball strings and I am planning on trying them out on another guitar soon.They seem to stay in tune more than other strings and also take to bending well. I use them on an electric acoustic and I am happy with the sound when i play through an amp.
