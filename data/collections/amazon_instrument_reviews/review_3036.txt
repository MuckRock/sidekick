This is not my first Planet Waves locking strap. They have never failed. Though the selection of colors and widths are very, very limited, it will keep your guitar secure if you can live with those limitations. Obviously if you have your heart on a certain strap other than these then go ahead and purchase straplocks. But for me these work just fine. Highly recommended.
