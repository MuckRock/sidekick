This product is a must for anyone with a rosewood fretboard guitar. My fretboard hasn't been cleaned/oiled in 15 years so it was extremely dry. The cleaner removed visible grime, the polish cloth shined up the frets, but most importantly, the oil returned the fretboard to a deep beautiful color and feel. I am very pleased with the product.
