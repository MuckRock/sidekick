Straplocks have been around for a long time, but now You can use the instrument with a regular strap as well, This dual design sold me on it..Easy to install on the guitar. A little difficult getting the lock mechanism installed on the strap, still only took about ten minutes to do.  The added security of knowing your 1200 dollar bass isn't going to hit the floor makes it very well worth the small cost of this item..
