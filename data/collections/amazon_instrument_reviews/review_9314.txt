Let me start by saying... I used to work for Line 6, so I know modeling pedals!I have nearly every modeling pedal Line 6 makes,but I was looking to minimize the rig that I take with me to the bistro-size gigs that I play most of the time. In general, all I really want is the Vox AC30 tone and maybe a delay pedal or some other single effect. I use a very small ZT Lunchbox amp for this sort of thing and it's solid state, so you basically get a nice loud straight ahead tone, which is nice, but makes our cover tunes a little less 'authentic' sounding. I heard some sound samples online comparing this pedal to the Tech21 Liverpool pedal and to my ear...there wasn't a $150 difference. Very convincing and just $40! I pair this up with a Line 6 M9 and I can get most any tone I need for Beatles, Tom Petty and all of the 60's 70's tones I need. Love this pedal!
