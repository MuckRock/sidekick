Sturdy guitar stand that works equally well for electric or acoustic guitars.  The stands are well padded where they will touch the guitar, and while the back support wouldn't scratch a guitar anyway, it's nice that it lines up perfectly with a strat scratch plate.  These stands are a lot sturdier than you would think by the picture - mainly because the guitar sits very low.  This low center of gravity makes it less likely tip when knocked.  The guitar is at a little more of an angle than I am used to with other stands, but overall this is excellent - I've replaced all my stands with these.
