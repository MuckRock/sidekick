These guitar strings are nothing special, and based on the amazingly low price nobody should expect them to be. They work well, look good, and are fairly durable at a very low price. I was remodeling an old Behringer and all I wanted was a fresh, shiny set of new strings. For playing, they sound pretty good. Best part, in my opinion, is that they're made in America, as well as the majority of Fender products. If you want to spend the extra money, I'd stil recommend Ernie Ball over these, or perhaps simply a higher quality pair of these Fender strings. You get what you pay for. As far as shipping, Musician's Friend did a great job getting the order out quickly. I'll be ordering from Musician's Friend again.
