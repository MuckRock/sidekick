I accidently ordered two of these, which proved fortunate because one did not have a battery when it arrived at my APO in Afganistan, where watch batteries are hard to come by. That being said, This is the most user friendly little tuner I have ever owned. I don't have a particularly good ear, but I can tell when I am out of tune, and I have struggled with other tuners in the past trying to get just the right tune. I bought this for a brand new backpack guitar, and I had the guitar tuned up in less than 5 minutes after I clamped this tuner on the neck. These are cheap enough to buy one for every guitar and keep it in the case.
