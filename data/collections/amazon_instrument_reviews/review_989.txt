I used this on a bass guitar with older strings and it made the strings brighter and more lively. I will try it on all of my guitars as it will prolong the life of most strings. I like the packaging and the small cloth it comes with. I use sections of t shirts to clean my strings and put them inside the packaging along with the cloth. This is a must for any fingerpicking guitar or bass player.
