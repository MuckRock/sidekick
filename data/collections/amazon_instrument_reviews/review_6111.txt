This is pretty much the ideal tuner, as far as I'm concerned.  It's true-bypass, brilliantly visible and easy to read on a dark stage, accurate, small footprint, durable, powers all your other pedals, and is under $100, especially if bought used...its virtues are many and varied.  If you've been using a cheap crappy tuner like I was, you'll notice the difference all the more.If you want a hyper-accurate tuner for some kind of technical work, the Pitchblack's tolerances might not be quite what you're looking for.  But as far as stage tuners go, it's got a tighter tolerance than the Boss stompbox.If you want a buffer in your chain, this pedal won't supply it, as it is true-bypass.If you want to hear your strings ringing out while you tune, this is not the pedal for you.  The output is muted while the tuner is engaged.  I prefer not to make my audience listen to me tune, so for me this is a non-issue.  Plus, I like being able to use the pedal as a killswitch.These are the only circumstances I can think of where there might be a valid reason not to buy a Pitchblack right this instant.EDIT: After some time with this pedal, I've noticed that when used to power other pedals, some of them don't like being daisy-chained from this pedal's power output, most notably tremolos.  But when the daisy-chain cable is connected straight to the power supply and the Pitchblack is powered like any other pedal, the problem vanishes.  Kind of strange, and I figured worth noting here, but I don't consider it enough of a problem to take any points off or recommend this box any less.
