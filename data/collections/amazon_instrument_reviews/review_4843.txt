This mic is fantastic! I've been singing, writing, and recording for almost 30 years and this mic is pretty much just as good as all of the silly expensive German mics I've used in larger studios over the years. There's a very slight presence peak, but nothing like most of the other Chinese mics. It isn't shrilling or peaky at all. Male tenor vocals and acoustic guitar sound great without any need for EQ whatsoever beyond a hi pass filter for the sub 100hz stuff. This mic is also an excellent candidate for a Michael Joly mod, he calls it one of the 7 audio wonders of the world because it makes no sense that this mic is this good at under $200. Michael mods these mics and you'd be hard pressed to be able to tell the difference between this one and the famous U87 with the German name that starts with an "N". I'm using it totally stock and it's been great. Buy it.
