I haven't read a lot of comments about these guys breaking, so maybe my wife and I are just ham-handed Shrek wannabes, but we have busted two of these little gizmos. They are basically made of a clip that attaches to your instrument, a round frisbee shaped tuner, and an arm that connects the two. The arm has a very fragile socket on each end that it fits into. She and I have each busted one, doing something mundane like putting it into a case or setting down a guitar on a carpeted floor.While the tuner works well otherwise (except the low E string on a bass which can be problematic), and the things don't cost very much, it's a shame we keep busting them. I do really recommend them as a good tuner and very very portable. Just be extra careful handling them.
