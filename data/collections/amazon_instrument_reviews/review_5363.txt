Good quality for the price, It's a mic on a stand. Plug it into an amp, computer sound card, karaoke machine, whatever, and belt out your favorite tune. Is this the most bestest sounding microphone on the planet? No, my friend. It is not. Sorry. But it is perfectly adequate for most purposes. The stand that comes with is light and I wouldn't subject it to too much abuse (don't invite Iggy Pop over, he's rough on mic stands) but it will do the job admirably if what you want is something to hold the mic while you wave your hands in the air like you don't care. And you're gonna do that, right?
