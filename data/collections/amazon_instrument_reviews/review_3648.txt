Construction is fine, and you can set it up in 30 seconds. It holds my bass just fine and the swiveling bottom is not an issue for me. I don't know why some people hate it. The rubberized neck holder protects the wood and the strap keeps the guitar in place. For under $10 and prime eligible, what more can you ask for?
