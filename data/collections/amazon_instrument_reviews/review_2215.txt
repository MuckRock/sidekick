[review updated after more time spent with the mic]Well, there's definitely some detail missing in the mids, but it has a generally pleasing "very fat" (aka muddy) tone. Makes a fair snare drum mic. Needs a bit of EQ for almost any practical application. I don't think I'd use it to track the vocals on anything, but it works. You'd be better off with a similarly-priced small-diaphragm condenser and a windscreen.
