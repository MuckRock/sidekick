Lots of juice, easy settings, very clean sound with all the horsepower you would need.  I haven't jacked it up all the way....I don't think the cat would appreciate that.  I get a little feedback every so often, occasionally it's a little overly sensitive to my volume control on the guitar,  but not enough to submarine this power packed amp.  How do you get that much noise out of an 8&#34; speaker?
