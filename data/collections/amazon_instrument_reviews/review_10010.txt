what a great little gizmo....I had a Boss RC-3 Looper,,,,,it involved too much bending over for me,,.and too hard to figure out...,the Ditto is so easy.,,,I take my trusty Fender Esquire...a cord...plug the chord in to a Caitlinbread Echorec pedal....take a short cable from the output of the Echo pedal to the input of the DIitto pedal.....then connect output of the Ditto to the amp....set Echo for multiple head repeats..i like the setting between 7 and 8 on the program select knob,,,,then turn OFF the echo pedal.....get ready to play....play the slow 4 chords to Maggot Brain....Eminor..D...Bminor...C.....count each chord as 123  456..as you come to start back on the Eminor,,,,,press the Ditto button one time with your foot,,,it will record you...,.play in tempo...!.,....its slow,,,,when you come back to the Eminor , you want to press the Ditto switch one time  to stop recording right before the 1 count,,,its tricky.,to make it play back smooth without loosing part of a beat,,...,.but easy with practice...anyway,....as soon as you press the Ditto switch to end the recording,,,,it will automatically start playing it back.,,then,....you turn on the Echo pedal....and proceed to jam on Maggot Brain.,,.,,till you achieve groovy-ness...,you don't want to record the rhythm part on to the  Ditto  with the Echo engaged,,,,that would make too much echo,,,,with both  the playback and the part you play on top of it, both echo drenched,,,,no good,,,,,that would be way too echo crazy..,it sounds much better and more effective  with a dry loop track and a super wet echo second guitar part,,,have fun...
