Man...when I saw these things a light came on in my head...it was an &#34;uh, duh&#34; moment.No noise, plenty of length and nicely spaced with right-angle plugs for all your standard 9V DC pedals.Any complaints about noise with these cables it just a symptom of something wrong within their setup.I had an old wall-wart laying around and put it to good use.Check the total amount of amperage draw (usually 500-1000 milliamps) to make sure your wall-wart can handle it and daisy-chain away!
