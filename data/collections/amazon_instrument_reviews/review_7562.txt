By now, you have probably read about the problem with the USB connection generating a high pitch sound during recording making the USB functionality unusable (an Amazon reviewer referred to this as a "fatal flaw," and I heartily agree). I experienced this firsthand, then read folks struggling with the issue on the Mackie support blogs. When I called Mackie support to seek a fix, I was told that the problem was well known and the newer lots had been corrected with new hardware. They sent me a new Mackie Board from the newer lots, and I returned my old one. I have not had any problems with the USB functionality since. I am thankful to Mackie for the great customer service, especially since I addressed the problem after the one year warranty had expired.I'm assuming that purchases made now will not have the problem, but if it does, contact Mackie to get a replacement.At this point, I am still running the board through its paces, but thus far so good.
