I've two of these stands. On one of them, the base part of the tubing has lost its tack weld. If you carefully separate the pie slice shaped black foam from the base of the stand, you'll see that the base of the tubing is welded there. Mine lost its weld, so the tubing is not secure to the grey base - they separate - I was left holding the tubing while the grey base fell to the floor!UPDATE: 1/9/12 GLEN INGLES REFUSES TO REPLACE OR REPAIR THE STAND. BEWARE! ...and you should be aware that the stand is assembled in..............wait for it................China. That may explain why it failed, but Glen Ingles could have offered to replace it. I guess he doesn't want me to buy any more of his products, or refer others to his products. Well, that's his policy. That's okay, he's got competition, and I'll be purchasing from them instead.
