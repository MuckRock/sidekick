A great item for the price. Comes in two pieces and is easy to assemble. You only need to put in the two screws that attach the head to the stand. Each screw has a wing nut that you tighten by hand. It took me about 3 minutes to put together with no directions. It looks to be very solid and goes much higher than many other stands. Its also pretty lightweight and as I said the head comes off with two screws if you want to break it down for traveling. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
