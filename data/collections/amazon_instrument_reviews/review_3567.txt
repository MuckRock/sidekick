This item really speaks for itself. It is a small microphone stand meant for use with a desktop. The base is nice and weighted, but not too heavy to be unwieldy. It's a solid piece that serves its purpose and offers convenience for anyone looking to place a microphone on their desk.I would recommend you grab a shock-mount with this if you don't already have one, as it transfers vibrations though the stand! But that is honestly to be expected.
