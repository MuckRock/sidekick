I was given free picks when I bought my guitar from a local guitar shop in town. The Retailer gave me some mediums. I find I do better with heavy thickness. I have a heavy touch when I play the guitar. With the different thicknesses I can choose which works best for me. From experience it never hurts to have extra picks around. Since I bought these I have been using the Heavy thickness ones. They really bring out the extra sound in the strings on the guitar.
