Tried D'Adario EJ36 Extra Light 12-string set on my Eko Ranger XII 12-string acoustic, and the EJ11 Light 6-string set on my Takamine.  No trouble stringing or tuning either set.  With the 0.012-0.53 Light weight strings I tuned a full note lower than normal to ease string tension, and they still sound fine.  Good acoustic, but a rather strong metalic, sound with a nice "ring", and notably more metalic than the EJ15 Phosphor Bronze strings.  Sound does deaden over time, as expected, but I especially noticed deadening on the high E and B non-wound strings, losing some of their "ring".  (Tried Elixir's for better longevity, but they did not sound as good to me as these D'Adario's.)
