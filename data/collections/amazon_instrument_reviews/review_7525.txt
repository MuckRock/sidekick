It works, and it works well.  It easily cuts guitar strings, ukulele strings, etc.  No damage to blades when cutting  heavy to light gauge steel strings.  If you change your own strings, this cutter is a must have.  It is very durable, the material is made of high quality metal, and it makes clean cuts.  The rubber grips are comfortable to use, and have red accents (and therefore easy to find).My only minor gripe is that it is spring-loaded to open.  I've cut myself with the blades reaching into the pocket a few times when I first got it.  Thankfully I don't change strings too often.  I also made a little leather pouch for the clipper end, and I put a rubber band around the handles to keep it closed.A must-have for your guitar/bass/ukulele bag.  Highly recommended.
