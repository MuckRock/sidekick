If your like me and have a big dreadnaught, especially one with a spruce top and a scalped X bracing, you should really get these strings. They bring out the brightness my guitar was hiding with the D'Daddarios and they are about the same price. Best of all they last extremely long, but I've broken a few strings over the past months. Overall great strings and pretty consistent.
