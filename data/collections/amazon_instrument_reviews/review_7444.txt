Well, I don't really know what else to say.. I ordered them for the guitar, Though I won't be using them for the banjo. (I prefer the sound of clawhammer banjo)The thumb picks fit my thumb perfectly, and the finger picks only needed a tiny squeeze to stay put. They feel kind of alien right now, as it's the first time I've ever wore finger picks, but I'll get used to them eventually :P.
