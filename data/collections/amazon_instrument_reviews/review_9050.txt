This microphone feels well built from all metal construction and the XLR connector mates firmly with most cables. The included cable is light duty, but not bad if you treat it with respect.The mike exhibits rich vocal tone throughout the frequency range with resonant lows, smooth midrange and crisp highs. For almost any singer or announcer, this will be just what they need. The cardiod pattern reduces feedback and background noise, making it a nice announcers mike for corporate video production. The sound is unbelievable, especially at this price. For under twenty dollars, this Pyle-Pro mike can't be beat.One issue I have with this mike is when using it on a Tascam DR40 portable recorder with an XLR to XLR cable, the Tascam generates a digital pulsing noise into the input electronics. Both of my Pyle Pro mikes have the same problem, but both mikes work perfectly with any other device. The Tascam D40 is known for this noise issue, but usually not when using the XLR input.
