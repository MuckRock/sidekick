The knobs are a little sketchy - they feel like they will break off if you step on them wrong- but the sound is just great.  This little guy has been on my pedalboard since it arrived in the mail.  I may buy a second one as a backup.  Behringer hit a home run with this one.  Not just a 'great sounding pedal for the price", but an honest to goodness great sounding OD pedal.  No true bypass, but if your pedal train is short or you have decent bypass on your other pedals you won't detect any 'tone suck'.  It sounds good enough that I don't mind the lack of true bypass!
