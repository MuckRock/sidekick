I'm a keyboard player, and in the past I had been spending $40-$60 for Monster's "delegated" keyboard cables.  But suddenly one shorted out on me after only several months use, causing me to question the "Monster mystique."  I began to compare the Monster keyboard cables with cheap, "off-brand" guitar cables and couldn't hear any difference.  No question it's a well-made, trustworthy (but not indestructible or infallible) cable, but I'm no longer committed to it at any price.  However, at Amazon's current "value" price for this particular Monster cable, it's a no-brainer.  Moreover, I no longer have hesitations about purchasing a cable that doesn't say "piano" or "keyboard" on it.  (One of my Monster keyboard cables even came with one end designated for the amp and the other for the instrument--but it was hard to see which was which in a dimly lit club.)As for length, 6 feet is ideal if you're playing through your own amp (my preference).  If you're plugging into a board or P.A. system, you'll want anywhere from 12 feet to 25 feet.
