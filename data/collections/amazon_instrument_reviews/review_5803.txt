I was very happy to get this bag and the quality is excellent!.  I have a Seagull S6 Dreadnought and it fits in this bag like a glove.  The zippers are also very high quality and this bag will last a long time. Another great quality of this bag is the insulation factor. I had to travel in some very cold weather to a friends home and I fully expected to have to retune my guitar... not so... it was still in tune and the cold had no effect during transport due to the insulation of this bag.
