There are plenty of reviews here that explain this unit and it works well. Before this I had been using tuner pro android app that also works well but I don't have it all the time.There is one big negative, it is absolutely useless outside in the sun or even shade. Can't even tell if it is on or off. Outside of that I am glad I picked the "red" version instead of the others.
