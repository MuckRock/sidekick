I started to play the violin a few months ago.  When I got my violin, I purchased the Korg CA1 Chromatic Tuner thinking I would not need a metronome.  The Korg CA1 also cost slight less.  However, now my instructor is having me work on scales using a metronome.  She has the Korg TM40 metronome.  I opted to purchase the newer model Korg TM50PW Instrument Tuner and Metronome.  It is great.  Based on my experience, unless you are sure you do not need a metronome, I would recommend everyone purchased the TM40 or TM50 (just in case) instead of the CA1.
