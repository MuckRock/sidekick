I like to display my guitars while also keeping them safe.  I bought 2 of these and have had them for a year now and they have yet to let me down.  My daughter still gets to them and tries to pull them off but she has yet to succeed.  Very solid constriction. I like that they pivot so if my daughter pulls them to the left or the right, the piece moves with it and returns it back to balance once she is finished.  Excellent design.
