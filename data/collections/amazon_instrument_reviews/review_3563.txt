I see mixed reviews here.  At this price, no telling what the quality control is like but as I wrote in another review on this type of item, you can buy 3 of these and if one fails, you're still ahead of the game.  They're so much less expensive than what one will typically find in a guitar or electronics store, well worth taking a chance.  Mine seems to be fine, doesn't look or feel flimsy at all.  I can't see any difference between this and what I buy in a retail package.
