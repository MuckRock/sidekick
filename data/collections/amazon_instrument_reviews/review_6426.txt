Most of the other reviews have pretty much covered just about everything I would say however I still want to say I love this tool. Not being someone who has had a lot of theory under my belt, it's been useful to help me learn the letters of keys. Slowly I am making progress at memorizing key signatures so that I know where I am on the fretboard & where I can go from there. I use it by putting it on my music stand, dialing in the key I want, turn on the drum machine & simply play the chords in that key to the beat. Then when I want to practice the relevant scales of the key, I simply look at the letters and count the fingering for the corresponding note. It's that easy.I will say that I do agree that the instructions are a wee bit too thin for my taste but music notation & theory is not a subject that the average player is adept with. Most folks are self taught like moi where theory is concerned. To really grasp it, one simply has to plod along actually performing the exercises repeatedly. But with rote repetition, eventually comes that "Eureka!" moment from time to time & more falls into place.Unlike some others, I'm not one to lug something this around in my gig bag. Who really is going to set & study material like this prior to a gig? That's what you do at home and it's called 'Practice' for a reason.I give this 5 out of 5 stars because it really is a fantastic learning tool & is relatively simple to use as long as you have some inkling of music theory. If not, you may want to take some lessons & then use this as a study guide along with your regular lessons.
