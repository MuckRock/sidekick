I started out wilth Balls when I first picked up the guitar in 1968 when I was 17. They were worth my part time minimum wage money and gave me what I wanted. A very reliable product that took me through the transition from an amateur to a professional lead guitarist. I highly recommend them. Keep a pack or two in your guitar case or gig bag!
