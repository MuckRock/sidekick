Not much to say about a chrome neckplate - it's largely a cosmetic item.  But my old one (with the serial number) was corroding pretty bad, and I liked the look of the new one.  A few people have mentioned that it's thinner, but assuming you also have the "pad" underneath (which you should) that was not a problem for me at all.  Anybody who dented theirs likely overtightened the screws.  Installation took all of 5 minutes and the neck is set up exactly as it was before.  Looks great!
