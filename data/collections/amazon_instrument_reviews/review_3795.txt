I LOVE this mic as an indoor studio mic.  I would not use it in a location with a high level of background noise as it is omni-directional and picks up quite a lot of extra noise.  But when the conditions are quiet like in a studio, this mic ROCKS. Clean, warm sound that picks up natural bass really well.  Good for vocals (singing), or instruments like a guitar or piano. Also have used it for some minor podcasting and it worked very well for that too!Comes with a dB limiter (-16dB)switch, right on the mic.  Works really nicely at limiting background noise.I would highly recommend this especially at the price.  Comes with a decent hard case and SWEET shock mount.  Very happy overall.
