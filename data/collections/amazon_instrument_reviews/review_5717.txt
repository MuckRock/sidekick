I got what I ordered.  However, if I had paid more attention, this is nothing but a standard power supply which I could have gotten much cheaper from a radio shack or like type store without the Tascam name on it.UPDATE 5-03-2012 after receiving comments and reading other reviews:I've gotten a comment and have read many comments and I don't know where the fault lies, but this power supply is NOT the power supply for the new replacement Tascam DR-07MKII.  The power supply for that unit is the PS-P515UIf you are unsure what power supply for which model Tascam recorder you have, go to Tascam's website and research it before buying it.The Tascam PSP520 AC Adapter/Power Supply For Mpgt1 is for and DOES work with the older Tascam DR-07 recorder.  I have been using this recording as a stand alone unit and taking a line out on a powered PA head using the this power supply and it works just fine and the quality of the recorder is excellent.
