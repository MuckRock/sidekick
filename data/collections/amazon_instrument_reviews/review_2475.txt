I've been using this product for years now and it is truly outstanding. It provides a terrific slick feel to the fretboard and makes playing much easier and more enjoyable. Clean, no residue from repeated use, and the glide across the strings is super nice. I use it regularly on my USA Stratocaster maple neck and wouldn't leave home without it.
