I've only been using the yellow one so far (only just started using them). But I like how the grip is strong cause of the rubber and the grooves. The colors and designs are pretty. As far as I can tell they are all the same width/thickness. For some reason I thought they'd have different thicknesses from a previous review. And so far I haven't lost any, yay!
