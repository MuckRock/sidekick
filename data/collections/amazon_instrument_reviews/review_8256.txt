I bought this because I got tired of looking up by-ear tuners online. It's so darn simple to use. Just clip it on, tap the big button, and play a note. The chromatic tuner is extremely easy to read and incredibly simple, and it automatically recognizes which notes are being played and adjusts to the note as you tune up and down. It was also very cheap compared to the other box tuners. Overall this is an amazing product and I don't see a reason why I would ever want another tuner again. I've had this tuner for about a month now and it hasn't failed me yet, though sometimes it can be a little stubborn and slow with determining when a note is being played and it does have a habit of being right on the mark one time, then if you pluck the string again, it will show it's off tune by a quarter-step or so. Just make sure you tune all the strings twice, and you won't regret buying this tuner.
