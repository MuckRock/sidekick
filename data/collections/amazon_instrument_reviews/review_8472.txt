This is really a great amp for the price.  If you're new to electric guitar, and you want an amp to get started, buy this one.  It has incredible versatility, and you can get started with trying out a huge range of different sounds without having to invest in a variety of effects and different amps.I got much more than I expected for the price of this amp.  I really like the Bassman and Twin Reverb settings.I won't claim that you can buy this amp and never have need for something bigger, better, vintage tube, etc., but this will more than meet your needs to use at home.  Buy the 20W version, which is plenty loud for home.  Later - when you have the skills to justify it, start buying some tube equipment.  This amp will help you figure out what tones you like for the music you want to play.I considered various new/used amps in the same price range, and I'm extremely happy I picked this one.  If you came by my house with some other brand new amp that cost twice as much as this and wanted to trade me, I'd tell you to go away.  But if you stop by with a nice Twin Reverb, I'd give up my Mustang ... but then I'd go buy another one.
