I've been using a Crybaby for going on 30 years now.  Some guitarists claim that having them in your signal chain affects your tone in a negative way.  Well, I've never noticed.To me these always feel perfect.  Also, you can adjust which part of the sweep you're using very easily - ie if you want more treble or bass you just the little "comb" that moves the wheel on the pot.I've tried other wahs.  Morley doesn't do it for me, and the Vox is very good, I just have always gone with what I knew.  No complaints with the Crybaby.
