I was looking forward to trying these, as I've loved this company's product since day one.But I think they've messed around with the gauge, slapped a meaningless &#34;HD&#34; tag on, and added a few bucks to the price. More profit in someone's pocket for marketing jargon.I have a smaller-bodied guitar, so these should have, by their claim, given me better balance, but imho, the opposite happened. The bottom dropped out, the top end stopped sizzling, and the middle strings totally took over when I strum with a pick.When I play with fingers it's better, but not worth spending more money on than the normal .012s I've been using (which I think I liked a lot better).It's possible that these work great on the Taylor guitars they were ostensibly designed for (color me skeptical), but I'd say if you're happy with what you have, you need not try these.Again, long-time user and big fan, but paying extra money for a slightly different gauge and a silly &#34;HD&#34; moniker... no thanks.
