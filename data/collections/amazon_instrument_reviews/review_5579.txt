These pedals are great!! A friend of mine said I should buy other pedals because these pedals aren't manufactured by a very known brand name but I went with my own judgement and I was not disappointed with them. I have increased my speed a lot since I've gotten em and I can pedal songs like "All Nightmare Long" and "Beast and the Harlot" now  =]  great pedals. BUT, it takes time to develop speed so don't think the pedals suck just because you barely get em and you can't go all Jason Costa on em
