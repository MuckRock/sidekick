This speaker has a very clear full range sound. I have it in a '63 Brown Deluxe and am very good with it. .In a way it reminds me a bit of a JBL with the smooth depth and clarity. If I want a little Ray Charles raspcan get it from the amp and not speaker with pick attack. Cool speaker and nice addition.
