I'm a guitarist with a passion for blues, so it was only a matter of time before I was going to pick up the harmonica.  I almost went with some of the cheaper options, but I am extremely pleased with my decision.  It sounds gorgeous (very full and clear), and I've already been able to start bending some notes--which I understand I notoriously hard for beginners on cheap harmonicas.As a blues guitarist I was tempted to buy a harmonica in D or A that, when played in second-position, would allow me to play along with blues songs in A or E (two of the most common blues keys; especially among the songs I like to play).  The second-position for the harp in C is G (not terribly common).  However, I think it is good practice to begin with a harmonica in C, since many of the beginner songs are in C, and the C major scale should be very familiar to most musicians.  In other words, as I'm exploring the notes, they make a lot of sense to me.  At this price, I won't mind buying a D or A when the time comes--it's not like I'm already at a level where I'm dying to play those songs anyway.  And, if I need to, there are a couple of songs I've found in G (e.g., Work Song by Butterfield).  That song along should keep my practicing for a long time.  If you are still reading this review, then you clearly are the type of person that would love this harp, add it to your cart.
