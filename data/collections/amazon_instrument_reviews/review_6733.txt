I primarily use this as an usb adapter for my headphones, so that I can connect/convert the 3.5mm headphone jack into my pc.The audio adapter is well built. It has a yellow LED light that is solid when plugged into an usb port and blinks when there is a device that is connected to it through a 3.5mm jack.Installation was flawless. Windows 7 64 bit installed drivers immediately.No issues. No nonsense. Simply works!
