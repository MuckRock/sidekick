I would recommend this mic for any application from home studios to a spare mic for any musician. They use a heavy metal casing that appears durable, and the cord is decent enough for live sound, but a very slight hum was present with my guitar/harp amp. I would pay this price for just the element! It is truly a great buy, and I would use it for armature work any day. I use it for harp (harmonica) and it works great, and it sounds smooth with vocals too. I would recommend it to any friend, and I already have... Worth every penny!
