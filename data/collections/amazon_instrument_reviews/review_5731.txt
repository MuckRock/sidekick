I also own an Olympus LS-10.  This gives me the same recording ability 96/24 but it is much less expensive.  You do get the ability to record with four channels which I am dying to try once I get my hands on 5.1 encoding software.  Also nice and not included with other brands, A tripod to hold the unit, a handle to use the unit like a microphone, charger, and earbuds.Some have noted the zoom doesn't have speakers built in.  If you truly want to monitor quality those tinny little built in speakers are not going to cut it.  You need monitors or quality headphones.  I find that inner ear monitors work best in noisy environments.As I said in the title there is a tradeoff in terms of material.  Olympus does seem to have more robust casing and controls.  This may be a big issue if you don't treat your equipment carefully.  Time will tell, but I have no doubt that this zoom unit is a solid product especially for the money.I am also looking at the Zoom H1 which will come out in Sept. 2010.  This product may actually be the LS-10 killer.
