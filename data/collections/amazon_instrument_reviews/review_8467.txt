The last amplifier I purchased was a Fender Twin valve some years ago. It is difficult to use in a small apartment - too loud!! So, after giving up trying to use this with the volume at '1', I searched for a smaller thing. This amp looked suspiciously cheap and, although the reviews were great, still was concerned whether it would be good enough. It arrived and I got into realizing it went on the web for downloading presets and all kinds of features, including recording. This was really a mind blowing thing. The built in sounds and effects are better than many of my effect pedals, and I no longer use my Zoom. Setting it emulate a twin reverb, with the effects used lightly, I am amazed at both the quality of this 'practise amp' and recommend this to anybody who wants a huge bang for their buck!!!
