I had always wanted a phase shifter but I never wanted to pay alot of money for one because its not something I had to have but I just wanted one. The reason I bought this one was because it was cheap. I got it and hooked it up and wow this thing is kool. You can get some insane sounds out of it. I mean some are so insane I asked myself what could someone possibly use this with in a song. But it's great. It does what it is suppose to do and it is a sturdy stomp box. Couldn't ask for more.
