I used this on my last stratocaster build. It arrived quickly and was well packaged. It is black and has a kind of white stripe along the edge, so if you are looking for just a solid black pickguard, be aware. The cool thing about this pickguard is that it already has aluminum on the back. I was shielding and star grounding all of my guitars and one of the painful parts was spraying adhesive on the back of pickguards and then putting foil on them and cutting it to fit. These already come with foil, so there is no need to shield them any more than they already are.It fit my body perfectly and I am happy with the purchase.
