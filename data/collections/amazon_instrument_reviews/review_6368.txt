I had the ones that came with my strat which I believe are Schaller's. I like the security of the Schaller's better because even if the pin is pulled they aren't going to let your guitar loose. However, my problem with the Schaller is that it would always unscrew the neck screw. I had to tighten it after every other use and let me tell you, not a little loose, but a lot loose.With the Ernie Balls, there was no redrilling which is needed with Strap Lock and the EB's screw is good and long. You also don't have to put them together like the Strap Lock, which is a bit of a pain.These have stayed very tight with no cause for my concern. I'd have rated 5 stars if the plastic you push together to insert and release was knurled. That would make it easier to grab and use. These will now be my default locks. The quality of the nickel is very good, too.
