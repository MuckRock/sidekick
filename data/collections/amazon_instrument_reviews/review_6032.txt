Works as advertised. Eliminates feedback as far as my experience is concerned. A little tight. It needs some force to put it into place. Not sure if there's no standard among guitar makers on the size of the sound hole and Planet Waves just did their best guess on a universal fit product. But on my Washburn it needs a little bit of convincing to get there.
