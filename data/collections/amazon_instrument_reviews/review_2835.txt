These D'Addario Medium Acoustic Guitar Strings come as individually packaged sets of three, with the necessary six strings in each set. Being new to guitars, we had no idea how often the strings would need to be replaced so this three pack seemed like a good starting point.The strings are good quality, produce accurate tones (according to our auto-tuner), and have held up well.Highly RecommendedCFH
