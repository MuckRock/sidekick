I ordered this product on a Thursday and received it in the mail the following Tuesday. Came very well packaged and with all the pieces. I was very easy to assembly and looks great! For the price, you really can't go wrong with this guitar stand. Works great for either an electric or acoustic guitar. The added strap on the front ensures that your guitar won't fall off. Padding on the stand also ensures that your guitar stays protected. Great stand for the price!!!
