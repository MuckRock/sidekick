works well.  the glass is a much softer, more subtle sound than metal.  it works on my pinky finger.  would have to have a much larger one for my ring finger and I dont have particularly large hands.  Just don't drop one of these on you tile floor.  they explore quite nicely that way.  I keep mine in a protective case when I am not using it.
