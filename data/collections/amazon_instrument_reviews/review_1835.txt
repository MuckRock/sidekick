I've been playing guitar for more than 20 years. I've played 6 strings, 12 strings, bass acoustics and electrics. When it comes to acoustic sound, these strings produce the brightest, clearest sound of any string I've ever used. Some strings have a "bright" sound and some have a clear, distinct tone - not muted or dull. Still, other strings have a rich, full resonance that carries through a room. This is the only string I've ever used that has all of those qualities. In fact, the first time I put these on my acoustic and went to lead worship at my church, several of the church members commented that my guitar sounded "better than usual" or "really good" that day. I've tried some other brands since I found these and always end up coming back to them.
