I've got two other Levy's cotton straps that I picked up at local brick and mortar stores and they're fantastic! I picked one up on Amazon and I was unaware that there was an 'extended length' version and that it was what I had bought before. I suppose it's just easier for theNo big deal though, just an observation worth noting because if  you just picked one of these up based on prior purchases (and you're a big guy like me and/or you play with the guitar/bass around your knees) you may not be getting what you thought.In any case, these are very comfortable (soft edge), they stick on you (as opposed to some other materials which may tend to slide down), and they last.
