I didnt have my research done correctly and ordered these because i wanted &#34;vintage&#34; for my &#34;relic'd&#34; build. Clearly my mistake that these do not fit the cheap necks sold here on Amazon. But no worries, Amazon sells adapters to make the &#34;large&#34; holes in the neck fit the &#34;smaller&#34; vintage tuning key posts.1 star off for not looking like the higest quality. I'm happy though and this was a good purchase at the right price.
