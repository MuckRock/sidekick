To start with, I didn't buy this guitar because it was cheap, but because of the unbelievable reviews.  I don't know if they all come out of the box like this one but in the past I have owned and sold my Gretch 12, my Yamaha 12, my ovation 12, but I won't be selling this one.  I've had it for 3 months now and haven't adjusted anything, only played this $169 12 string from American Musical Supply / amazon.  It is the best playing best sounding 12 string I have ever played period...  This guitar set off a couple of other Epiphone purchases (2, one for my son) AJ220SCE's and ES-339, Also great guitars.  Most of my life Epiphones were dull over coated junk, not anymore, and it seems that Epiphone is selling cheap to get people to try them. I own Gibson Studio Les Paul, SG, '87 American Strat, Martin D35, Washburn Rogue, all nice guitars most for a LOT more money. This guitar is a NOBRAINER cannot believe the value.  American Musical Supply is also great, the first AJ220SCE came in with a bad neck and AMS emailed a return FedEx lable in an hour and after I dropped it off and it was logged in at a UPS outlet around the corner I got an email that the replacement guitar was on the way. When it arrived 3 days later it was a good one! :))  5+ star service.
