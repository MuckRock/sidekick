This amp sounds phenomenal for such a small package and a single 10 inch speaker!  It sounds great right out of the box.The overdrive channels amp models are some of the best I've heard from modelers, pedals etc. Not much use for any of my many pedals with this amp because better tones are already in the presets and I havent even looked at the fuse software yet.I am very happy with this amp and it sounds great at lower volumes.  If you mic up this will work for small gigs.  The build seems very good.I don't think you can find a better sounding brand new amp for this price.
