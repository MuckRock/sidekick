This is my second SM48 in 25 years! What's the difference between the 58 and the 48? The 48 is made in Mexico. There is a noticeable difference in tone with the 48 with the on/off switch. (I did not buy that one) If feedback is an issue in your practice space, get the one with the switch, otherwise opt out for better clarity.I say go for it!! Save $50.
