I needed a cheap mic stand that didn't break the bank.  This little guy fit the bill.  I don't know if it could stand up next to the Hercules stands that I have used for years in terms of long-term durability, but for a simple, home-use stand, it is perfect.  It is sturdy, the knobs feel tight and is balanced.  Great entry-level stand!
