What can i say?  this is a xlr cable.i just have to stress if you want gear that will last for a while and not have a crappy connection somewhere buy decent cables.This one has quality ends on it and that makes me happy that this investment will last years down the road.So buy a decent quality cable like this one and not the cheapest!
