One of the great surprises in the last couple of years has been the MXR Carbon Copy delay pedal. Designed by Way Huge founder Jeorge Tripps, is a great analog delay for under $175.00. Using bucket brigade circuitry, true bypass and a very simple 3 knob interface, the Carbon Copy is a very flexible unit. Utilizing the "modulation" switch, you can achieve a slight chorusing sound (like the flutter from old tape echoes) which can be adjusted via the internal trim pot.The unit has a small footprint (like most MXR pedals) so it is very pedal board friendly.This is truly a great sounding delay so try one out
