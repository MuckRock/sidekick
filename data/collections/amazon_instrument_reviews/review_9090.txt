It's not a thing of beauty so if looks is what you are after then this wall mount isn't for you. If you are looking for a solid, easy and convient place to hang your guitar where it won't get stepped on or kicked over then this is for you. It works great to hang a standard size guitar on. There is a little wiggle room left so a oversize may fit but I am not sure. It has a soft foam cover over the steal arms to protect your guitar, hangs by the neck where the head stock curves out so the tuning pegs aren't bumped and hangs straight, just touching the wall with the body. I recommend it.
