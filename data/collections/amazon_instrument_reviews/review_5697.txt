I have an Axe-Fx 2 that requires quality monitoring (I do use studio monitors, but sometimes I need something that no one else can hear), and for a while was using the Senheiser HD 280 Pro headphones.When I put these on (without burning them in), I was blown away at the difference! for $20 more, these cans are more than worth the extra cashAlso better, is the leather wrapped around the arc- much sturdier, while the pad on my Senheisers is flaking off, piece by piece.
