THis is a 5 star stand, considering the price. Sure, it's not as sturdy as one costing a lot more, but it does what it's supposed to do without any problems.  I don't forsee any mechanical issues because the construction seems solid enough.  It's a music stand, so I don't see how it would take a lot of abuse.
