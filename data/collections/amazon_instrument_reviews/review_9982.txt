At first, I wasn't sure what to expect from these D'Addario "Balanced Tension" strings. D'Addario makes some pretty strong claims for these strings, including "greater dynamic control and a more consistent feel between strings for evenly balanced bending, strumming, fretting, picking, plucking and slapping".I can't really speak to those claims; all I can tell you is these are darn good strings, sound great, feel great. I recommend them highly.
