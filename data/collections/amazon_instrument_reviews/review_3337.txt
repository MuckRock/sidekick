Without going to extremes and spending two-hundred bucks on an NOS tube from 1957, I recommend for us frugal individuals to go the cheaper route until you get your first platinum hit.JJ's tubes are well-trusted and have become the defacto standard when selecting quality and tested reliability.BTW - 12AXT and ECC83 are the same tube.I can't remember the last time I had a JJ tube go microphonic beyond control.I have played full time for over 27 years. I use these.Hope this helps.
