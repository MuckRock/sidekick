My band was playing out one night, I use an amp stand that was on the stage. I really liked how elevating my little amp helped improve it's sound and decided I had to have one. I started searching around and found this product. The price was right so I took a chance and purchased one sight unseen. The Musician's Gear stand does everything I needed it to. It arrived in three days was well packaged and easy to assemble. It's light weight, portable and well constructed and would safely support an amp up to 75lbs. I would recommend this product to anyone with an amplifier 75lbs or less.
