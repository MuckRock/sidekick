The CM-2 is magnificent: [1] It produces beautiful overdrive (one that doesn't destroy your guitar's tone). [2] It has independent "High" and "Low" tone controls, and these controls are extremely sensitive to even minor changes--thus allowing for great versatility in tone-manipulation. [3] It features a switch that allows you to pick between "classic" overdrive and an extra blast of distortion ("modified"). [4] The case is made of metal. [5] It comes with a cover for the knobs so that you can avoid altering your settings when depressing the pedal. This pedal will not give you "metal" distortion; for that consider Digitech's TL-2. Instead, it produces a warm, old-time overdriven tone. I love this thing!
