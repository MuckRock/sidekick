We all know it's just a container with a sponge in it, no biggie. I bought it to get Super Saver shipping on something else and because I plan to keep an all-solid acoustic guitar at a weekend place where it will sit unused for long periods of time. Jamming it between the guitar strings and getting it hooked onto them feels a bit rough on the strings. But it should do the job.
