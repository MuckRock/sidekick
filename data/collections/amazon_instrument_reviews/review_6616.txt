I use these cables to go from the balanced outputs of my digital piano (I have a pro model with XLR outs) to the inputs of studio monitors or audio interfaces.  Works every time.  Balanced signal is so much better...no more issues with ground loops or other problems.  Just clear as a bell.They were cheap and the build quality is fine.
