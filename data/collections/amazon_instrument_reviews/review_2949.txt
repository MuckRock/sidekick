First off, I'm NO ukulele expert. That being said: I replaced the original strings on my newMahalo U-35PK Sparkling Soprano Ukulele Outfit in Pinkwith these. I know they stated Concert, however, reading up on this, they can still be used on a soprano or standard uke. Immediately I noticed a difference in sound on these strings. Like another reviewer said, it's not going to perform miracles on a cheap uke, but it sure helped out a lot. The sound is quite a bit louder and so much brighter as well. I'm loving the sound. Also, I really like the way they look on my pink uke; it's a nice touch.  I would definitely recommend these.
