What can I say that has not been said before about this excellent cymbal?.... great choice to add some trashy color to my cymbal set up (all Wuhans because they are cheap and blow away most of the big boy companies). One thing that surprised me was how BIG the sound was and how nice it cut right thru my other cymbals. You cannot beat this price or quality of this cymbal. Placed it on top of my 18' crash and it looks great!!!
