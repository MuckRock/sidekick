A booster makes your signal louder!  That has been the case with all the clean boosters on the market like MXR Micro Amp, EHX LPB-1, BBE Boosta Grande, Modtone, etc.  They keep your guitar's original tone, make it louder and when pushed enough, will add a good amount of gain & grit.  But there is something else going on with the Xotic EP Booster.  Yes, it also makes the signal louder, adds gain or a little dirt, but also makes your overall sound bigger & wider!  Based on vintage echoplex units used by guitar heroes like Jimmy Page, Duane Allman, Gary Moore, etc.  This pedal is really small in size, has one knob & the footswitch.  It does have an internal dip switch.  You open up the back of the pedal & choose you own setting.  I leave at the classic setting, turn the gain knob at 9 or 10 o'clock & leave it on all the time.  I tried it before & after my OD pedals and my personal preference is "after"!  Being in front of the amp, it didn't do much when I tried to use just the dirt channel on my tube amp.  I put it in the FX loop & it boosted the signal alright but I didn't like it as much as in front of the amp boosting my OD pedals.This is one pedal that will stay on my board.  I doesn't take up much space, built to last and will make anything you throw before it sound better.  It does one job only but it does it so well!
