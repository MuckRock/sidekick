Overall this is a pretty good stand. It is sturdy and has good adjustable heights. A good value if you have lots of stuff you need to hang on it. I took one star off because the bottom part is kind of awkward fro holding up the guitar as the guitar strap peg is at the very bottom and is the only thing touching the bottom of the stand which make sit easy to fall and I've had it fall a number of times. I'm just thinking that they could of designed the bottom wider. Also the edges of my guitars are always touching as if there is not enough room for them on the stand.
