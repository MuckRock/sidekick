I can't find a single complain about this amp. The amp modelling is fantastic. Plug in for a mic/CD/M3 player. Quality driver. I'm not going to go through all the features that yo ucan read o nthe website. I used to play through a chameleon and separate amp in a rack to get these effects. Only thing I wish it had was the ability to save a custom sounds. But you can't ask for much more for the price of $399. You won't be disappointed with this amp.
