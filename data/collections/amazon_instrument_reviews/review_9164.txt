I bought this tuner for my mandolin.  I have to play a little louder than I'd like for the tuner to hear me.  The display is not as nice or easy to interact with as some tuning displays I've seen.  But it's so small that I never have to take it off, and it's doing its job well.  I'm pretty fond of this little guy.
