I purchased these for a Fender Squier Affinity Strat. Be aware that they will NOT fit a Squier without drilling some holes. The stock tuners have one peg - these have two. Despite this, installing them was quite easy. They have a high build quality and work great. I was hesitant to buy locking tuners at first, but now I'm glad I did.
