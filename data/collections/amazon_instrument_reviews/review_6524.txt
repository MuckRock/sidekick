I had a custom-made pedalboard, made with wood also, it was great in therms of protecting my pedals and with the space but maan it was heavy, only with 7 pedals and that was getting me problems with my back and shoulders... with this i have 13 pedals and i wont say that its not heavy bcuz it is, but is the same weight but i got 13 pedals!! Thats a huge difference.... the only thing that i maybe dont like is the bag, i know it wont last A LOT OF TIME, but in general is the best pedalboard ive had and i wont change it.. maybe for another bigger like the pt3 but still gonna get pedaltrain... the best
