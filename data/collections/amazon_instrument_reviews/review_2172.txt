I've been playing for 8 years and I own 4 electric guitars.  All of my guitars are strung with D'Addario 10's.  They sound great when they're fresh and in my opinion they stay fresh the longest.  I play at least 15-20 hours per week so I put a decent amount of wear and tear on my strings.  It's really the durability that sets these apart.The Amazon price is terrific.  I like to restring my main guitar a little bit more than once a month and I can buy a year's worth of these for the same price as 1 set of bass strings.  I'd definitely recommend these strings and recommend purchasing through Amazon.
