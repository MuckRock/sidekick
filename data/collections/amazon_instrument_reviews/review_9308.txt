I love the sound of this pedal.  It's as versatile as can be.  If you want to sound like 5 Dimebag Darrels, then don't buy this pedal.  If you want a nice drive that is responsive, this is for you.  I employ this pedal more than my boss distortions and my electro harmonix distortions/overdrives.  I have noticed the on off light is intermittent, but the pedal still effects the signal either way.  For a pedal that I have stomped on so many times, I'm not even the least bit concerned.  For an inexpensive unit, this thing rules.
