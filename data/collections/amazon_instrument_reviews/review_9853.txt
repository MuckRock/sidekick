This is a great little addition to both my violin, and my mandolin.  While some reviews on here have mentioned using it on a ukulele . . . no.  It doesn't work that way, unless the sound hole is not directly over the strings.  If it is, the pickup will mute the A string, and it's annoying.Anyway I digress.  The pickup adds a bright, clear sound to your instrument, without feedback or hassle.
