This strap has a fantastic old-school look and vibe, and I've never had it slip off while playing.  The only downside is that it's a bit rough on any loose skin.  I could never play with this strap without a shirt and sometimes if it rides up I can feel it on my neck (but that is very rare and only if playing with a loose t-shirt).  For 99% of situations these strap rocks.
