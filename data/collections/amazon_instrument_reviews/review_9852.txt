If you are looking for a compact size pickup this is it.  I've tried it on my fiddle and a mountain dulcimer.  It is great for a quick way to get electrified.  Lead wire is not very substantial, but if it breaks in the future hopefully I can just buy another one.  To get the best sound you should probably run this unit thru a preamp.
