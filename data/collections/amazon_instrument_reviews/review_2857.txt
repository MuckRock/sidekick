I've been playing for 40+ years.  I've seen dozens of guitars come and go until I found my 1948 Gibson J-45 and I've tried dozens of types of strings.  Some guitars sound best with Phosphor Bronze.  Some sound best with 80/20s.  I still have an all Koa Martin guitar that is *so* bright that it sounds best with the normally tone-killing Elixir Polywebs. Got a guitar-banjo? Try silk-and-steel or silk-and-phosphor. Trust me.  I've been through my John Pearse phase. Pyramids?  Yep. Tried 'em.  I really liked LaBellas.  The problem was that back when I was using them, they would tarnish in the packaging.  I don't know if that's still the case.Anyway, the bottom line is that D'Addario phosphor bronze are my go to string.  They set the baseline for every guitar I've ever owned.  (Note: That's baseline. In some cases, I've decided something else sounded better.)  For many guitars, including my J-45, there's nothing I've found that I've liked better.Also worth noting:  The string that sounds best depends not only on the particular guitar, but also on the type of pick one uses, the type of music one plays, and the way one approaches the instrument.  The string that's best for bluegrass with a hard attack may not be what's best for delicate finger style.Bottom line: Don't follow leaders.  Watch the parkin' meters.  Experiment.  But, D'Addario PBs are a great place to start.
