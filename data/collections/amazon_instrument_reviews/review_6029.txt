I am finally feedback free!  I use this on my 310 Taylor with a K&K; Pure pickup system.I play mostly in a church worship team, and am usually right in front of a monitor.This blocks the tones entering my guitar via the soundhole.I don't get a huge loss of tone, but a little bit.I will take that over having to worry about moving around and getting feedback like crazy!Highly recommend.
