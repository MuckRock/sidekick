The good:InexpensiveContains most of the hardware you need, drum mounts, etc.works with 3/8 or 5/8Has a carrying caseThe kick mic has a good low frequency responseThe bad:Has locking clasps with included keys, that are too big for the key holes.Does not contain any of the cabling and you will easily spend as much on that as you did on the microphonesNo instructions on how to use the mounts, or little things like you can use plyers to remove the 3/8" adapters from the mountsKick mic needs a mic stand, one is not providedThe ugly:The two condenser microphones are incredibly sensitive but at the cost of an incredibly high noise floor. There is a ton of hiss at any level setting and it will make your recording sound like a 1/4" casette tape unless you EQ out all of the highs on the condensers to kill the hissssss.
