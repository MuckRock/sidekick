This pedal sounds great with my fender excelsior with it's 15 inch speaker and also very good with my 1960's danelectro tweed amp with it's bright weber ceramic 8 inch speaker. I can use the entire range of the tone knob to go from aggressive growls at the low end to screaming lead tones at the other end, and it never sounds harsh. The clipping is sweet and musical, with a sound very reminiscent to cranked amplifier stacks with their front ends being pushed with overdrive pedals. Sometimes I feed this with my SD-1 or my Danelectro D-2 overdrive and it just puts it over the top. FOR THE PRICE, these pedals are outstanding. The QC may not be perfect, and there are duds out there, but I would say that it is worth the risk, as the circuits in these are just like vintage pedals although they do use cheaper components and boards and such. As long as you dont literally stomp down on the pedal and you dont drop it down the stairs, it will last long enough to make it worth your while. Also, the blue LED is somewhat bright and annoying, but it is a good indicator so I guess it does it's job. Overall, rock on!
