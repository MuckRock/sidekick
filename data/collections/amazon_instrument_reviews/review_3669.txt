I am a believer that if you have a musical instrument, it has to be out if you are going to use it regularly.  with these sturdy stands,  my guitars are out and around the house and they seem to &#34;talk to me&#34; every time that I walk by.  this encourages, if not compulses, me to pick them up and play them for 5-15 minutes at a time.  these stands are inexpensive, light, and hold the guitar well.  I would not recommend them for heavy, on the road, stage work, but then again, most of us are not on the road nor the tour.  we are just playing for the love of it.
