These cables have been solid; we use them in the studio every single day, and have held up so well compared to many others I've ordered for less.Yes, $70 on cables seems like a boring way to spend that money, but don't be fooled: nothing makes you looks stupider during a recording session than a blown cable. Not only do these hold up and sound great, I've found that when working with a complicated studio setup, I'm always surprised how helpful the color-coding actually ends up being. For the price, this is totally worth it.I use these with the following to really color code my studio setup:Color windscreens:GLS Audio Mic Windscreens MicrophoneColor electrical tape:B004ZZVHGWColor patch cables:B003VYBNHGDefinitely worth it! Makes a huge difference!
