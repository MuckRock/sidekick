This is a great tool the only issue was it was a little tight and it squeaked loudly as i was attempting to use it..  i had some graphite powder and i put a little around the screw head on the winder part and now it spins freely without noise.  Its so much nicer to not have to wind those tuner heads by hand when changing strings out.  the wire cutters also work really well. Im glad i bought this product.
