I played the Wedding March at my son's outdoor wedding back in April and I needed an amp so folks would be able to hear me.  I plugged in my Martin HD-28 and all went well.  The Martin has an Fishman Infinity Pickup (narrow style) in it and together with the pickup, this amp put out a real sweet sound.  As I said, the wedding was outdoors and everyone complimented me on the Wedding March, so I know they heard me - and I didn't even have to crank up the volume.In my den, when I practiced, I barely raised the volume, else it would have been WAY too loud.  So, in short, I'd buy it again.
