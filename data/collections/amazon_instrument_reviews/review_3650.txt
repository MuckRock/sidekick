In life you mostly get what you pay for. This stand really isn't an exception. Getting what you pay for though doesn't mean that it won't do what you need it to do. This stand is light weight and inexpensive because of it. The great thing is, it doesn't need to be any heavier or needlessly fancy to do exactly what it needs to do. It's a great choice for someone looking to keep their guitars from becoming damaged while they sit out waiting to be played. Even though they will not get damaged while laying around they are still easily accessible for you to play as opposed to having them stored in a case.For $10 a pop you can afford to have one for every guitar. Putting them on display and allowing them to be handy when the urge strikes you to play. You now have no excuse for your expensive (or cheap) guitar to get beat up from laying around.
