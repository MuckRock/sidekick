Whats not to  love, inexpensive, and does it's job....After reading some of the rather poor reviews, I checked it out for  signs of poor quality or workmanship... Only thing I found was that  the pin rockrd a bit... there were three screws in the body that I used a screwdiriver to tighten up.. .I suspect that complaints of falling apart could have been from missing or loose screws... Not much of a chore. I did back out the screws a bit and added a drop of clear nail polish on the threads for some insurance that it would not loosen up...Anyway, that is the view from where I sit...Just got it and used it, I will add to the post if things turn bad..
