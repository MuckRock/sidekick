I have one gig bag already (not like this Fender), and wanted another gig bag for a third guitar I bought.  This Fender is lots better then my other bag.  My other bag has the storage pockets on the broad bottom part but not the nice storage pockets up on the neck like this Fender bag.  The Finder's padding is a bit better than my other bag also, but, of course, neither is as good as hard case.I am handicapped with a prosthesis on my right leg.  I need the back pack straps on back of a gig back to help me transport my guitar, because I use crutches and they require my hands.  The Fender's straps are great.  The left strap on my other gig bag would often work its over and off my shoulder and then the guitar would hang all catty-wompass and it became difficult for me to carry.  The straps on this Fender stay put - love it.The guitar I tote in this bag is a Martin HD-28.  But, it can also my Blueridge BR-180 or my Seagull S6 Coastal Spruce.  Either of my three acoustic guitars fit the Fender gig bag perfectly.Like I said, its a great gig bag.  If I ever need another, I'll be getting another Fender gig bag.
