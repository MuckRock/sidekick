I have 2 one spots which came with the 5 multi plug cable, after reading a little bit on the internet I read that the one spots can handle almost 10 pedals each (depends on the pedal, power handling etc.) So I saw they had an 8 plug cable and figured I would try it out. With adding many more pedals to my board, this is perfect. Def recommend if you have alot of pedals and only want to plug in once.
