WOW!!!!! this thing is fun to play with!!!this is my first delay pedal, so i cant compare it with others, but im so happy that i bought it! ive had it for about a month and played it for hours every day.  you can tweak the echo in 100's of different ways.the case seems to be sturdy and looks like it will last quite a while as long as i dont get over zelous and stomp on it too hard. im very happy with this product and im becoming a real fan of behringer products.
