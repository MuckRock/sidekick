At the $600 price point for an all tube amp PLUS reverb and tremelo (well, there are two pedals I won't have to buy) this is insane. It is not only REALLY loud, but you can do anything from jangly pop to Pink Floyd to hard rock (high gain modern metal heads, though, might want to look at ENGL). I dialed in a Richie Blackmore tone the other day and just started blasting away.It's also a hefty beast and should stand up to sustained use.The only thing that was a drag about it was that the footswitch, which controls the reverb and tremolo, is sold separately (at about $40 street) and everybody was out. I managed to snag one, but it involved a bit of luck. They should be restocking stores in a couple of weeks.
