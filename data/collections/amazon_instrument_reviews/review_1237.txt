This is such a lifesaver (or an effort saver). Every guitarist should have this. In my opinion, there is nothing more annoying in the world than changing guitar strings. This makes the process so much easier. It's a 3-in-1 product that clips the old string, pulls the pins out, and winds the new strings in. On top of it all, it's pretty affordable.
