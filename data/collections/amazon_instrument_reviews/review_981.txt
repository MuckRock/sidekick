I am in agreement with others that state this is a must-have. I battled with fret noise on recordings and fingers dragging on the fingerboard. This really lowers the friction and makes for a much more playable instrument and supposedly protects the wood. I've used it on the back of the neck as well and it helps as much as on the fingerboard. I rub the entire neck down before and after I play. It makes the guitar smell like it came right from the shop, which I suspect is what they must've been using all these years and never told me, though I never did ask...foolish me. Since I've recently gotten into doing my own setups, where I've read many forums and posters have recommended this and I figured what the heck, it's less than $5.
