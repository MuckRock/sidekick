I just got done installing these. My three guitars and mandolin take up virtually no room in my small house anymore, my guitars are decorating the wall at the same time, and my guitars won't tip over either. Not only was this the least expensive solution out there, but also the most space efficient (to keep my wife happy).I used the screws that came with the mounts and made sure that they went into a stud. You can usually find a stud by looking for a screw or nail that the drywallers didn't get covered with drywall mud. Once you've found one screw, then your studs are either 16 or 24 inches apart. With the mounts screwed into wood studs, I don't see any way these are coming down. The mounts fit everything from my 12 string acoustic, to my heavy electric Strat, to my mandolin beautifully.Gotta love Amazon. With so many options to choose from, you can come up with something great and inexpensive too. And the reviews give you an idea of what real consumers are experiencing with the product.BTW, this seller really got these to me fast. This was a great buying experience. Thanks DisplayGiftSCOM.
