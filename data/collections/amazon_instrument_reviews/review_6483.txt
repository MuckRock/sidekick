A light weight but well made covering for my jasmine guitar. Good material, good zippers, good design. There are much more well padded soft and hard cases available but they take up a lot more room around the house when not in use. I like this one because it provides enough protection without being cumbersome. For travel, you would need better, but for most uses, this is a good choice.
