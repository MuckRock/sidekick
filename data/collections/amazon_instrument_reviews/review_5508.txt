This stand was very inexpensive and I thought I could save a bit of money and give it a try for use with my Epi Sheraton II.  Unfortunately I am just not all that comfortable trusting my guitar to this stand.  It seems to be built well enough for what it is, but it seems quite unbalanced and always on the verge of tipping backwards. Also, for left/right stability you need to set the guitar just so in the bottom support piece or it seems 'tippy'.The construction itself is 'ok'. The rubber tips on the feet seem fine, but the front legs seem overly long with the rear foot overly short.  The body cradle is nicely padded but isn't firmly seated inside the center tube and even though it has a rudimentary locking design, it just isn't all that solid.  You can adjust the height but just inserting the top piece into the bottom caused deep scratches in the black paint of the top tube piece.  It ships with an unsightly white UPC sticker which must be tediously removed if you want it to look good onstage.Granted, the Sheraton II is a large and heavy guitar but the OnStage is billed as "Heavy Duty" and to me that means SOLID, which this stand just isn't, at least with larger guitars or basses.  When you use a guitar stand you can't afford to be dealing with something that is in the least bit temperamental or you risk damaging your instrument and possibly even your livelihood.Bottom line, you get what you pay for. For smaller, lighter guitars, Strats and such, it may be ok, but for Dots, Sheratons, 335's and larger Gretch's, I just wouldn't trust it and that goes for most basses as well.I will need to look for something else.
