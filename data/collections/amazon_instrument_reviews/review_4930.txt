This pedal works well in my rig, I have two Boss EQ20's advanced EQ's and sometimes they are complicated due to the 10 bands they have, this little toy does the trick, and does it very well, I think that people who writes negative reviews don't know how to use it, it can require some time and experience but having much more expensive equipment to compare this pedal is a very good eq and for the price is unbeatable, highly recommended... or you can go for the overpriced $100+ Boss original unit, at the end is the same, maybe a little quieter but essentially the same if you know what you are doing.
