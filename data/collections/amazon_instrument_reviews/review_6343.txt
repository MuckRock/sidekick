Nothing makes a customer more mad than to buy something that just doesn't work.  Well,....that's not the case here.  This power supply is well made (durable) and performs to the specs supplied.  I guess a person can take the risk of buying a variable output adaptor with the proper power pin configuration,...but why go to all that trouble?  This product lives up to it's calling.  Besides, who wants to keep changing batteries in the Stobe Tuner (Planet Waves) when this power adaptor is easy to plug in and forget.  I gave it a 5-star rating because the price is fair, the product is well made and works, and it was shipped well within the promised time.  By today's standards, that's as good as it gets.DP
