I've read where people are using bottle caps instead of these. My guitar is more valuable to me than that I suppose, because I'm not trusting that my expensive gitty won't hit the floor. I mean you pay for a quality instrument right? Why on earth would you skimp on keeping it safe? I'm sorry but that's just idiocy in action. This isn't 1960, get an upgrade already. I play standing up 95% of the time, so these are a necessity. I have had these separate on me when taking them off hastily, but all except one snapped right back together. When I first started playing, I had a brand new (to me) guitar hit the floor and the neck break because I didn't use them. That's something that should only happen once in your life, if at all. The only complaint I have is whatever happened to the round ones? They were a bit more appealing to the eye and do the same thing just as well.
