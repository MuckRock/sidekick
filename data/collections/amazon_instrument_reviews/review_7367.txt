This will give you the delay and compression that you need for country twang on the telecaster. It will also give you a rhythm track to play along too. The rhythm machine has 44 rhythms with adjustable volume and tempo. It is not perfect as it has no on/off switch, it reverts to default mode when you power it up, it is a little hard to set volume and tempo on drum beats. It only cost around $60 so perfection should not be expected. For practice and the home studio it is great.
