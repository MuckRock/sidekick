This soundhole cover is one of those products that belongs on the list of essentials for an acoustic guitar player, right up there with a tuner, string winder/cutter, cleaning cloth, pack of extra picks, and capo. It's designed to eliminate feedback when plugged into a sound system, which it does nicely. It's also great for sealing up the body of your guitar if you want to dry it out or dampen it quickly (as in 2 nights like that in a case).
