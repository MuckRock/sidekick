This Snark tuner is a very clever gadget that is simple to use (even for my children) and works well. The display is easy to understand and is very accurate (confirmed by our guitar teacher's meter). The Snark also has protective grips so it will not damage the guitar finish.Everything should be this easy to use and work this well!Highly Recommended!CFH
