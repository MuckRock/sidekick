I ordered these picks in bulk to use while I was recording/producing. I absolutely love these picks and swear by them. I've been a guitarist for almost 7 years and these were the picks that I landed on years ago and stuck to. I've had years of lessons, licks and picks and these are the absolute endgame for me! Perfect grip for leads and perfect thickness for Rhythms. I'd order again if I had to.
