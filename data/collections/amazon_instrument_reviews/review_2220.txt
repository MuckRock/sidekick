I bought these strings after they were suggested by a customer at a local shop. I play a cigar box guitar and stay with uncoated strings to get a traditional sound from the piezo pickup. This is my first set and I am impressed. These are not the most flexible strings as another reviewer mentioned, but seem to work well for three string chords and sound good through both a tube and acoustic amp.I would purchase these again for my needs. Previously I have used Ernie Ball Earthwoods which were  more flexible in light form, but great also. It would be a toss up for me between the two, but I do know these sound alot better than the basic Matin SP strings I tried previously.
