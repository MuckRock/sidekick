Works exceptionally well. In fact, this works better than regular, single-layered pop filters I have used in the past and your sound is either not compromised at all or the sound is barely effected so that you would not notice.Well worth the money. The build and design of the pop filter is sturdy and can attach to a majority of microphone stands.
