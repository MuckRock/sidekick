I bought this gig bag to carry my Fender strat around. I'm just starting to learn guitar so I didn't really know much about my options. I figured I had a Fender guitar so I might as well get a Fender gig bag.Little did I realize how good this one really is. Most gig bags don't come with all these storage pockets. There's plenty of room for a few books, an electronic tuner, string winder, strings, whatever.Padding could always be more, but that's the case with probably any soft-shell bag you buy.All-in-all, I like this bag more and more since I've discovered that all the other options in the price range aren't nearly as good.
