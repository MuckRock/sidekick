This is a well made guitar strap, and is exactly as described. Suede is of course less slippery than smooth leather, and 2 inches is fairly narrow. If this is what you want, then this guitar strap is perfect. If you prefer the strap slip easily, or distribute the weight of a heavy guitar more, then it won't be.Definitely top notch if this is what you are after though. 5-stars.
