This stand does its job quite well.  The only problem I can foresee anyone having, is there are no instructions on the proper way to unfold it.  It's not a difficult problem to solve though, so be patient and all will work out.**** Update****I just want to add that the seller of this item went above and beyond, as far as customer service.  I have nothing but praise for them!
