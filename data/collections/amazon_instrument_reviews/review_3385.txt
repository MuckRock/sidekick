casual, part time guitar player here. I use it on the back of the headstock to always have picks with the guitar when I pick it up. The one I received was all black, not brown on the sides as in the photo. No matter. It is a bit larger than you might expect from the photo. I dont know if that is to accommodate a larger size of pick, or what. It is big enough that 'normal' electric guitar picks can almost turn sideways in it. It also likes to give you more than one pick at a time. Both of which I would say make it not  a contender for fast pick replacement, like in the middle of a song. But it is good for keeping them all in one place, either on the guitar or a desk, toolbox, etc.Nice little item for $2
