I got these for a parts-tele I built and I'm really happy with them.  Like all vintage tuners you may need conversion bushings to make them fit modern peg holes which are usually larger.  But they look great, work great, stay in tune and are completely vintage spec.  I have a '57 reissue strat and I can't tell the difference.  One thing I've always loved about vintage tuners is that you tuck the strings in the center of the shaft so it keeps the headstock looking neat.
