I am a musician who needed budget home studio equipment. Paired up with a nice pop filter, this mic is able to produce some amazing vocal recordings. You'd be surprised to find out how many famous youtube musicians or podcast creators use this mic. It took me some time to get the hang of miking amps, positions and vocal distance, but I am truly getting more than my money's worth for what it's putting out. Check out some demos of quality on youtube if you need further convincing. I am very glad I made this purchase.I've owned this mic for 2 years if you're curious about durability.
