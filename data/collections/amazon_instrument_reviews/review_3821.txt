I swear by these quick release clips. I can't imagine working without them. I save so much time each time I use a quick release clip instead of unscrewing and re-screwing the original clips. These are a great way to to mix and match multiple clips with multiple stands. The first items I purchased when I started my last job as an Audio Engineer was these. I've got no complaints. They work great every time.
