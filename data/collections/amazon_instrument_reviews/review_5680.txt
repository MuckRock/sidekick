I've been using Sennheiser's for years and while I am very pleased with them I decided to try the ATH-M50Ss on a whim.  I spent a little more ($50) than what I've been paying for the Sennies but it was well worth it.  I get more of a flat response which is exactly what I needed for monitoring my audio mixes.And a trivial bonus ... a straight cord.  I hate coiled cords.
