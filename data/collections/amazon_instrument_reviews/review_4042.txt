i did pretty much almost hurt myself attaching this strap to my guitar...but all in all I will say it was weeeeellllll worth the effort! It looks and feels great on my Luna Butterfly...and I like the durability it seems like it will have. Pretty great strap overall and I am very very much pleased with my purchase!!! all smiles here :)
