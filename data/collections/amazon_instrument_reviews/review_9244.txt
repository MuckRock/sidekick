I have recently come back to the guitar after several years on hiatus. I have several bad habits, including a tendency to need to grip the pick too tightly or I drop it at some point. On a bit of a lark I bought a pack of the Clayton BeeHolds (0.5mm,) and really like them. The hexagonal hole really does make them stay in place with much less grip required, and I find the hole to be in a very natural-feeling spot. The pick is fairly long, but I have not had any accuracy problems with them, and so far durability has been good.I still use other picks too, but I really like these and can't imagine not keeping an ample supply on hand.
