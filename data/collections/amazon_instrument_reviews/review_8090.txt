For years I have fell more and more in love with my Yamaha CGX-111SC. Stil, nylon acoustic guitars have this weird sound when played on open spaces without using the piezo (note: change to a better piezo system, LR Baggs are great!), high notes were lost in the thin air covered by the lower notes. I wanted to experiment with this item... result: GREAT!!! I finally got to listen to what I use to heard from the recordings at controlled environments. The sound is richer and clarity makes unique.
