For the price, this box works just as well as as any expensive one would. Just put in a 9v battery and it works right away. Three knobs to control tone, level and distortion to get that perfect sound. I do recommend you get a power adapter, because this eats us batteries like crazy. I accidentally left it on for a few hours and the juice was all dry, batteries are expensive, get the power supply. Overall, this is a good budget buy, you won't need to money for quality with this.
