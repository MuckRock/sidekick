This pedal works well, and lets you sculpt a pleasing sound to suit the situation.  A little goes a long way with the sliders, and the gain and level functions are occasionally useful.  Nice accessory for a tube amp or an amp lacking good onboard eq.  It makes it much easier to dial in the exact sound you want, easier than messing with eq knobs that can interact with each other.Ten bands is a little overkill for guitar.  Three of them are outside the range of the instrument, but I bought this one because I like that it blinks if clipping, it has the extra volume and gain sliders, and comes with the AC adaptor.  This adds no noise that I can tell, except if the sliders are up it amplifies noise already there.It's an all around quality product that I imagine I'll still have twenty years from now.
