There are so many reviews of this little jewel, I won't bother going into details but it's everything I could have hoped for and more. The sound quality is amazing and it's very easy to use. I'm using it for so many things including a music player for my truck. I take it everywhere and it has never let me down. I had to get my own carrying case but for the quality versus price and accessories that ARE included, I have no complaints.
