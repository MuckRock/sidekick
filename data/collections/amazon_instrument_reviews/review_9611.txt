Not only do they seem to last a little longer with less wear but they sound good with my cheap no-name Japanese knock-off. I play mostly hard-rock these days with some mild distortion but on occasion crank it up for some tech-metal and prog-rock for solo projects where I'm playing pretty fast and sometimes hard. They also handle de-tuning well and even when using pretty loose open tuning like DADAAD, they are clear with good sustain.
