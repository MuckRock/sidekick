Easily the best quality capo for it's price. Looks great on any guitar. I came across SHUBB a few months back, when my capo finally gave out after 12 years. I bought the C1 stainless steel version of this same capo which made a good transition between several of my guitars, but I had to adjust it any time I went to use it on my Les Paul which has a 50s neck and fretboard.Ordered off of Amazon and it shipped the same day.I just got it in the mail yesterday, and it snapped right on the LP with a firm click. I didn't even have to adjust it. It looks amazing in use... and is just the best and simplest design.You know when you feel it lock into place that it is staying there no matter what. Don't forget to remove it when you guitar is resting. It's easy to forget it's there. Forget the oversized medieval torture device style capos... this never effects my fret thumb or forefinger--exactly what I was looking for in a capo.I will have these 2 for a long time, and I'm a Shubb guy from this day forward.
