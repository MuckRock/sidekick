I've been using these strings on all my guitars, electric and acoustic, since the mid-70s.  I've tried many others, but always come back to Ernie Balls.  They tune better and they keep the "new strings" sound longer and that's the main plus, but they just "feel" good.  I play and practice a lot and I abuse strings...these can take it and come back for more!
