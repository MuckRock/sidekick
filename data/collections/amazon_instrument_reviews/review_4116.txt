By definition, medium is an in between size. But when it comes to guitar strings, most of the range goes from extra light to medium. On that scale, these strings would be above a literal medium. For me, the guitar is not an everyday instrument. I don't typically spend five hours a day with one, and sometimes go weeks without picking one up. But I do have periods where I will spend many hours a day playing and don't want something that will kill me.Medium in the guitar string sense of the word is too much for me. Light and custom light are easier to play, but can make a higher end Martin guitar sound like one closer to the bottom of the line. For me, these light-medium are exactly where I want my strings to be.If you like Martin's medium, find them a bit much at times, but find that you give up too much when you play much lighter ones, you may find that these are a great choice. I don't feel I am missing anything compared to the Medium. If I had two identical guitars with new strings of each type, I would probably find differences in a side by side comparison. But without that, I don't think I'd notice the difference with normal listening. With the lighter varieties, that would be far from true.If Martin extra light and light were the skim milk and 1% milk of strings, these light-medium would be the 2% that came along for people who wanted something lighter but still came close to the whole milk taste.
