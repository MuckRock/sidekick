While I don't have a ton of experience with pedals, I really love this one. Keeps your guitars tone but you can add some fatness and a mild to fairly substantial crunch and adds some nice sustain. Although this is a tube-overdrive I actually think it sounds better with my solid state amp. It is nothing real drastic but that is exactly what I was looking for, a nice robust boost while keeping your guitar tones integrity. For the price I don't see how you can beat this pedal. I also have a Digitech Jam Man and it is awesome. No complaints with this outfit.
