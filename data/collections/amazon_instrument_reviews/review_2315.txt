I'm rather disappointed with this item as I put only FOUR (4) picks into it when it snapped apart. I use the Dunlop Tortex 1.0 mm picks and perhaps that's where I was at fault - I maybe should left it at three picks.However, my bench vise and some superglue have remedied the situation nicely. Thus beware of how many picks and their gauge BEFORE you push them into this holder.I give it 3 out of 5 stars for reasons stated.
