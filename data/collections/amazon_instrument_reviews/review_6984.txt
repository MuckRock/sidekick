This is a great little ukulele to have around the house.  I originally ordered a different one and got this one in error, but Musician's Friend showed exceptional customer service and refunded me the entire amount of my purchase (which included a change out set of strings), and told me to keep it all too!  I was floored!Back to the ukulele-At first I thought this was cheap enough to knock around and abuse, but I found myself actually liking this one!  The action is fine, and with a change of strings, it sounds pleasant too.  I used the D'Addario J53 black nylon strings.  The tuning is a bit off, but easily compensated. It's a fun strum and well worth the $20!
