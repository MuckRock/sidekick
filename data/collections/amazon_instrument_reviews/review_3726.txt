Have these on my Tele, very interesting to play around with. I bought the regular gauge first and usually use pink slinkeys on all my electrics, the regular chromes where like telephone wires compared to my regular gauge so I bought these instead. These were a lot easier to play and more like my slinkeys. They still are heavier and you can really feel it when bending but they add a completely different feel to playing guitar and your tone. When playing these I tend to play more sixties inspired, the flats help capture that surf guitar tone which is really cool. I really like them but they are completely different and I wouldn't recommend them to everyone. As far as CQ goes these are great, no problems, feel great, sound great.
