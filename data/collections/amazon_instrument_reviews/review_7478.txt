now it doesn't work(same day i got it). In my control panel the mic is there but it doesn't pick up any sound. Followed all the instructions, emailed blue support and at first the person was quick to reply but now its been 3-4 days no answer. Maybe i'm being impatient but the mic only worked for a couple hours since i got it... If you guys know of any good alternatives please leave a comment.
