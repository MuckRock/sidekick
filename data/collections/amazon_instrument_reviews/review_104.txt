Well made. Works as it should. However, seem to be getting a little bit of noise from a shotgun mic straight into a D800. (more than the usual expected)To see if it was the Mic, cable, or adapter; Tested it going straight into a Zoom H4 recorder.Seems to be a little but more noise going through this adapter cable than straight into the XLR input.No big surprises. Minor clean up in post.
