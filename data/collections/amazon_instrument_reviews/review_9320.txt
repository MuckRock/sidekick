For a Fender licensed product, the build seems a bit on the cheap side, the plastic is kinda dollar store quality, but this tuner tunes very well, comparable to more expensive Korgs or Snarks. The screen is bright, and while it does not change color, the dial is easy to read. Buy a couple and leave one in your guitar case and another one in your car, so you can always tune up for those unexpected performances.
