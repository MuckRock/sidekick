I own two Hercules GS302B stands for my electric guitars, and I couldn't be happier with them. When I needed an acoustic stand I turned to the Hercules GS301B and have no regrets. At the forefront of my purchasing decision was the safety of my guitars. Not only do stands have to hold guitars securely, they shouldn't harm the finishes of the instrument. Unfortunately many stands will harm the nitrocellulose lacquer on many higher-end guitars; since I have two guitars of this nature, protecting them was of the utmost import to me. Fortunately these stands protect most nitrocellulose finishes, and I have never had problems with mine. The stands themselves (both varieties) fold up to be very compact if you need portability, and support the guitar very securely. I don't gig with these guitars, so portability was not paramount to me, but stability was: these stands are extremely stable and are very sturdy (mine reside on a carpeted floor, and I have never had any issues with them tipping over.) Some people may not love the yellow and black "bumble bee" coloration, but I actually find it whimsically industrial. I am completely happy with all three of my Hercules stands: they are safe, portable, rugged, and won't hurt the finish on most guitars. If I need another guitar stand, it's a good bet I will buy another Hercules.
