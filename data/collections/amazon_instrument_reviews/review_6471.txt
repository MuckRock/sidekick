I love it.  It works great.  No ambient noise or clicks, as some have suggested.  It's as easy as, you plug it in and/or flip a switch for the desired effect, and voila it works.  So, duh, why do I need to say something moronic or interminable regarding this subject.  Just buy the product and get on with happy music making.  Thank you On-Stage.
