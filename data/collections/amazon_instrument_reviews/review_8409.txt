Works perfectly with iphone and ipad.  The app that comes with it seems to be very sound and well designed.  My only complaint is that the product itself seems incredibly empty and fragile since there is no weight to it.  But it hasn't broke yet and it might never break.  Works perfectly with ear buds with mic/controller.  Great idea!
