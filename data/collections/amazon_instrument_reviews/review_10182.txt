This works well.  Has nice ergonomics, fits all of my acoustic guitars, and is easy to use.  No adjustments are required for my guitars, but it is nice to know that the options is available for this capo.This capo comes with a pick holder.  And, it is expandable with aD'Addario NS Micro Clip-On Tunerthat attaches onto the lower arm.  I do not use a pick, and I use my own tuners, so neither of these two features is applicable for my needs.This capo has moved up as one of two highly used capos for my guitars, the other one being theG7th Performance Capo.  The G7 capo goes with my Takamine New Yorker, and this Planet Waves goes on everything else.  If anyone needs to use a capo, I loan out myKyser Capo.Recommended.
