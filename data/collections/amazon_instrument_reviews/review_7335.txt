I have an Epiphone Les Paul and this stand does not hold it at all.  The holders are too far apart to keep the guitar from sliding through onto the floor.  Maybe it's a decent stand for an acoustic or a fatter electric.  But given that Les Paul is a pretty popular model of guitar, this should not be sold as an electric guitar stand.  I'm rating it for what it is sold as, and for that, it gets 1 star, and only because since there is no zero.
