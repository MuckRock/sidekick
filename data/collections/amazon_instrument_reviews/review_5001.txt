The locking tuners are a great add to my 09 strat. They went on easily but, I noticed they are staggeered so make sure the the taller tuners begin at the low E. After the install I stringed it up and played for a couple of hours. Cosmetically they do look cool and functionally which of course is the purpose they keep it in tune. I am not a big trem guy but when I use it I do not "now" have to worry about its tuning.
