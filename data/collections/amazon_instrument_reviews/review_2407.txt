I've used so many guitar cables over the years that I lost count. It's hard to find a tough, low noise cable for less than ten bucks anywhere, but this one is the best one out there for the price paid. Its made well, with strong plug ends and a thick yet flexable cable covering that I love. I use it for all of my equipment connections, and it simply works with no problems and no noise that I could detect. Try it out, you'll discover the same as me and my band mate's have, that this is the best cable for the money on Amazon!
