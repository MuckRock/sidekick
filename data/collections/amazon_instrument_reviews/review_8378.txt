My mother "plays" the guitar (I am a banjo/mandolin player), and the Snark SN-2 came in the mail while I was gone for 5 days.  She opened it up, got curious and tried it out on her guitar that prolly hasn't been in tune since... I dunno... and she LOVED it!  lulz  This little thing really is my absolute favorite instrument accessory, both a vibrational and an internal mic pickup.  I was using my old Korg chromatic for those times I wanted to see if I was singing the correct note... and was actually pleasantly surprised that the Snark SN-2 had a mic.  One less accessory in the little bag now.  :DI am slightly ambivalent about the silent metronome function, however... its neat as you can play without the TICK TOCK distraction and still look up once in awhile to see if you are on beat, but as an actual instructional tool for keeping tempo... mmm, I would still highly recommend using an audible metronome.Side note, if you have friends/family that play a string instrument, be aware your Snark SN-2 *WILL* be making the rounds.
