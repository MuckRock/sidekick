Let's face it, I'm sure there are better compressors than this for about 3 to 4 times the price but this brought my amp into the light. Bright, crisp, clean, balanced sound reproduction. Got the Danelectro wall wart for it. Worked great. The free shipping was lighting fast and I got more than I bargain for. Get one!
