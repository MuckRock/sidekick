Recieved the accessory kit, only to find I was missing the black tip for the five-way switch and tremolo bar tip.  Trem back cover fit nicely and the knobs help me complete a few other project.  Saving the p/u covers for my next project, but it would be nice to get the trem tip and switch tip sent to me.Great customer service.  Received missing parts, immediately.  Finished the project.  I definitely will be using this seller again.  Thanks
