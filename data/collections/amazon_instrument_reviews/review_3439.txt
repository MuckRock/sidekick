for the price you can't really beat this little amp, the only down fall is that at full volume with the gain up, the little speaker gets kinda muddy, but for a bright clean tone it works well, the tone controle offers a well rounded array of tones and the gain is great from a blues to metal tone of gain.the headphones input just is handy when wanting to play into the wee hours of the morning without disturbing anybody, but with the headphones hooked up you can really hear the digital sound it makes... but for the money it's a great buy
