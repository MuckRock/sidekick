Excellent tuner.  I appreciate it's compact size and often leave it attached to the headstock.  It performs as it should and appears to be quite durable.  Being able to angle the unit is great.  The back light works well in dim light and of course the piezo mode makes tuning in noisey invironments quite easy.  They do mean it when they say to replace the battery when you get it.  Mine lasted for a couple of weeks.  It was insightful of them to tell you of this need upfront.  All in all well worth the money and the transaction went flawlessly.
