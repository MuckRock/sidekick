I use this small stand in my vocal isolation booth to hold the iPad that remotely controls my audio software via the Splashtop app. Very secure, effective clamp that connects to a vertical pipe. I covered with thin carpet to reduce reflection, and I find that it holds my iPad securely. I highly recommend.
