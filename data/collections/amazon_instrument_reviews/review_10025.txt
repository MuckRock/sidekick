These headphones are 100% amazing. I could not believe the sound quality. I have been an audio engineer for over 30 years and let me tell you these headphones will match those worth $200-$300...nice wide spectrum and frequency response, you will love them, well worth the price. (no I do not work for Tascam)... the first pair I bought the cord got stuck and was yanked and broke very easily....so I ordered another pair, because the sound is amazing, I just need to be more careful next time!!...but this headphone has a very delicate cord connection and construction...I have yanked my Senhieser's millions of times and the cord never broke, so be careful with the cord on this headphone...it is not the best, but the sound is superior.
