This is a great quality microphone and at a good price. Keep it mind it is XLR, for those that haven't noticed. XLR is a better quality than other connections. It's the same physical shape and size as a rock band microphone (Looking for a good comparison.), and is MUCH better quality. It's flawless in quality and doesn't give any feedback. I would recomment for anyone, especially having such a great price.
