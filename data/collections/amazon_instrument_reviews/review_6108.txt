The best tuner for your board in my opinion! Great display, easy to view/read, and a simple click on and off that isn't noisy. Since it is true bypass the pedal turns off when it is not engaged, which is a great feature since the battery will not drain while not in use even when things are plugged into it. Silent on/off, and I have two of them. Recommend this to anybody looking for a tuner for their rig.
