This item works well for keeping the mic away from the stand allowing room for guitars. I tried a flexible goose neck but it was way too loose and would not hold the mic steady. The locking teeth on the adjuster firmly hold the stand in 1 position. The short extension in the picture is not on the unit I received but it really is not needed it works fine as delivered. I would purchase this unit again and again. It is a good piece and a good deal!
