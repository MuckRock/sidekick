I've used the classic Kyser capos for years with my acoustic guitars.  They definitely look great, but they tend to lose their tension and allow for string buzz after a year or so.  That's my experience at least.  These trigger capos may look and feel awkward to a lot of people, but they are wonderful.  I get a perfect barr at every fret and it feels like this will never wear out.  I've had one for a couple years now and the only problem I find with them is that your friends tend to take them for themselves and it's easiest just to buy a new one.  Highly recommended for acoustic guitar players!
