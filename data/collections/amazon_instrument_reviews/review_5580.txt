I bought this for my son's 7th birthday. He badly needed an upgrade from his Ludwig Jr Kit's bass pedal. This is a great pedal for younger kids, or people learning the double bass for the first time. Seems a little slow, but, as I said, for my 7 year old it is perfect. Seems well build, but for pros or the gigging musician, you may want to save up some change and buy a better pedal. 5 stars because of the price and what I was expecting to get. I wasn't expecting pro level gear for a sub $100 pedal.
