I ordered this for my Jackson DKMG. This is my 1st Gator case, and I'm very pleased with it. It is similar to SKB and fits my guitar very nicely. Being lightweight is a big plus as well, and also the secure feeling of having a HSC. I will definitely buy this again for other guitars and highly recommend it. Just remember that this model is for standard type axes; Strats, Teles and such.
