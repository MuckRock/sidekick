Love it. makes plugging in a lot of stomp boxes easy peasy. Quiet power supply, lots of cables and end caps and adapters, for what you'd pay for a single power adapter. It's nice not having to  dig out half a dozen power supplies just to set up and play. About the only thing missing would be some right angle adapters, but I'm sure you can find them somewhere.good quality, and the cord is extremely long for a dc power supply.
