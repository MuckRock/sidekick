Super cool pedal with tons of applications. it sounds great for recording. i wouldn't take it on a tour or anything, it is plastic. the harmonizing function can be buggy at times. the trem function works great. it has a input for an expression pedal and i would recommend using one to save your pedal the wear......it is plastic. I love Behringer pedals, for the price you can get a ton of great sounding and functioning pedals at more than half the price of the Boss counterparts. one of my favorite pedals of all time.
