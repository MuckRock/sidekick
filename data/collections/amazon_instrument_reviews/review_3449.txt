Ernie Ball makes extremely durable products and has a very reputable name in the musician community.These strings are affordable and last a VERY long time on someones guitar during normal use.You will not be disappointed in this product.They sound VERY clean and bright and if you use a product like GHS Fast Fret after playing the strings last twice as long and stay clear and bright longer.They do have a coating that will wear a small amount and turn black under the strings if you fail to clean them properly.
