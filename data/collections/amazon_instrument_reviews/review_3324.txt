I do like these strings. Had a few packs of these from Christmas. Opened up one recently and the .009 string or 1st string "Was Not" in there. Next time I'm gonna have to open up the package to make sure they're all in there, should measure them too. Didn't open them to keep them sealed until I was ready to use them, no more.
