this little stand is great.  I am looking at it right now, across the room, holding my Zager guitar.  it is light, non obtrusive, holds the guitar well, and it is portable when Mr. Guitar and I take a trip together.  I highly recommend it.  keeps that guitar off the bed, floor, table or anywhere else it is not really suposed to be.
