I was upset when I bought the mic stand and didn't know the clip didn't come with it.So I had to order a clip later.Nevertheless, It has good design to dampen the shocks.It is also rubber in construction so it won't crack like the other low quality clips.It is a bit big for the cabled mics (so you have to insert it deeper to hold it snag), but for wireless mics, it is good.I would recommend it.
