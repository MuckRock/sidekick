I've never been much of an effect pedal guy; lots of batteries and cables when I can just get a good tone direct into my Fender tweed. I've recently conceded to using more effects and have gone, quite frankly, hog wild on new gear. This is the best of the pedal purchases I have made so far, it's not quite the MXR sound I was going for but there's definitely something here. The boost works very well for lead work and really ups the sustain on my Strat.Just two controls, one for volume, one for compression. My only concern is that the knobs feel like they could be much more sturdy, I haven't pulled them off yet but I would guess the pots have plastic posts as opposed to metal ones.
