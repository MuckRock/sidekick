I bought this based on video reviews on the net.  My first impressions:To my ears, if the OCD / Ultimate OD simulates "fat" power tube distortion, this pedal simulates a lightly distorted tube pre-amp, with a bit of edge, sharpness, the kind of edge the tube amps have.  The focus knob seems like a tone knob, maybe more in the upper mids than the treble, but it does the job well.I wish it had a bit more gain.  Surprisingly, this pedal with the gain on 10 and the tone on 10, gives me a great metal tone all by itself!  If i boost the pedal with say a few db of clean boost, it gets me exactly where I'd want to be (a dry, tight metal tone, kinda 5150ish.  And while this isn't the purpose of the pedal, it is how I've ended up using it just because it sounds better than any amp sim and produces less heat than my tube amps.  It's tight, its raw, there is no fizz and no boomyness, just a healthy low end.  Crank the knobs on this thing to 10 and you have a very aggressive, tight tone that makes even my Marshall Class 5 tight and grindy enough for Scandinavian style metal.Over all though, this is great for lightly distorted / edge of distorted sounds.  It gave my clean tone a sharper, more "amp like" tone (that is, midscooped slightly with the tone knob in the middle.) I think this would be great for Hendrix covers on his cleaner stuff, it just has that chimey, vintage amp character (very early marshalls, older fenders) with the ability to go from clean to dirty with simple attack variation.  If your clean channel is overly "flat", this will liven it up to more "sharp", scooped tone, which to my ears sounds more vintage.Basically, from Hendrix to modern de-tuned metal (with a definite mids emphasis - not "80s marshall mids" but  modern mids emphasis).
