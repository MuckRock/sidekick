Dang that's metal. Were the first words I said when plugging this thing in to the line. With a wide range of sound and versatility with just one pedal and two buttons is awesome. The only issue was with some manufacturing detail. The input and out put jacks are screwed up and nearly broke my cables when trying to set it up for the first time. The buttons were way to stiff and made a horrid crunch the first time I used it and after talking to amazon it turns out that just seems to be how it is. Be sides that its metal, nothing more nothing less. Razor sharp high ends or some butt draggin muddy slop of sound either way your covered with this pedal.
