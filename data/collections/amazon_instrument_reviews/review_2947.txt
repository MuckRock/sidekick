I wanted a black ukulele string to replace the stock strings for my yellow makala dolphin. These will work for soprano. The J53 is a good investment for under 6 bucks. They provide enough string to change your ukulele twice over and feels nice to play. Increases projection and tone to any stock strings. Not the best, not the worse strings, but an improvement.
