I'm going to be honest, I have a cheap guitar. I payed $120 for an Epiphone at my local music store because I just play it recreationally. (Bonfires, sitting around the house, etc..) So I've never really put a nice set of strings on it because I figured strings aren't really going to make THAT much of a sound difference on this guitar, but I was way way way wrong! These strings aren't even that expensive, actually they're only a few more dollars than the usual cheap strings I put on my guitar. Yet, they completely  changed the sound of my guitar and it sounds like I forked over some money for a decent guitar! The strings are high quality and they feel so smooth under my fingertips! I used to play once or twice a week, but I can't help but want to play every single day just to hear these things sing!
