I've tried pretty much every harp out there, after having played the regional blues & jazz circuit for about 10 years.  Lee Oskar harps are the best value.On top of it, Lee Oskar actually called me once just because I left a question on his website!I've met Rick Epping (of Hohner harmonicas) at NAMM -great guy- but he never called me at 3:30 in the afternoon just because I could not identify a song I thought he was playing on!I carry around between 10 or 12 harps to a gig, so that is at least $290 for a set of Lee Oksar harps.10 Suzuki Manji harps, while nice and the phosphor bronze reeds are great, would cost nearly $480 - presuming you could find them.I will not say I've never blown a reed on a LO, but I will say that $22 for a new set of LO reed plates beats $48 for a new Manji, at least in my book.On top of it, all they really did with the Manji is discontinue the "Bushman Delta Frost" harmonicas and rename them so they could double the price.Lee Oskar harmonicas are inexpensive, they are simple and cheap to repair, easy to play, have great tone, and are even easy to identify since the 1st & 2nd position keys are printed right on the comb.  That feature is great for beginners who might not be able to keep them straight yet.Give them a shot.
