Definitely provided extra gripping surface.  The pick extends out from the rubber 'shell'.  Obviously the thin pics were thin and the thick ones were a lot stiffer.  Since you have the shell they are a bit thicker than a normal pick which may have to be gotten used to.  I know for me I prefer to grip the pick really close to the tips for harmonics and on these your fingers definitely don't slip but it's a bit more pic than I want.  So I do carry and use these occasionally but they aren't my everyday pick.
