This capo seems to handle quite nicely.  Spring loaded trigger like a Kyser (still my personal fave) but with an added tension adjust adjustment on the spring.  In time this will probably become my favorite as there seems to be some benefit to the tensioner helping to keep the guitar in tune.  The only issue, if you could call it that, was that I have always used the Kyser's that have the non moving side of the squeeze handle above the neck as opposed to under the neck like this one - after many years of playing, muscle memory sometimes has me reaching to the wrong place when adjusting position on the fly.
