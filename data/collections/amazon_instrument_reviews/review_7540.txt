I have been online shopping banjos quite... extensively.  Ebay, Amazon, 3 dozen+ online shops, reviews from multitude of sources, investigating manufacturer home sites, etc.  I did the same for this banjo, and although there is actually very little out there about this particular banjo, I still felt very comfortable with what little I put together information wise.  And frankly, at this price, it gets my warmest recommendation for those on a tight budget (sometimes, you just can't afford 400+ dollars for a mainstream name beginner brand).  Additionally, mine came very well setup from the seller (aside from the inevitable tuning).  And its purty too!  I would also deeply recommendSnark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic Tuner... absolutely the best tuner I have ever used and makes the various banjo-tuning schemes a breeze.Be aware, in order to avoid possible confusion, Jameson Guitars is actually a sub-brand of Davison Guitars, so if you order and look at your peg-head and it says Davison (like mine does) and not R.W. Jameson, its the same maker (yes, I examined Davison's home site as well as the Amazon Seller's).
