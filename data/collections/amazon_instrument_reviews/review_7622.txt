When I first felt this strap, I smiled...This is so supple to the touch, making playing with it a great experience. Yet it's durable enough even for the roughest of players. It is fully adjustable, allowing for all body types. This is the first strap that I've bought in a long time. I have a Planet Waves strap with studs and I like it very much. I'ts the only strap I've ever used. Untill now. Now I have it put away and I'm using this one. If yore looking for a new strap, I highly recommend this one. Trust me...You will not be disapointed by it. Yeah it looks a little plain, but it doesn't slide around while playing and I love it!! BUY IT ALREADY!! XD
