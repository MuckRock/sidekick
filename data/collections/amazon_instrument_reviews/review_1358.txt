I honestly really didn't find this thing useful at all. First, the wire clipper side is relatively bulky (no flush cutting) and doesn't open easily (very stiff action), so trying to get the clipper onto the wire with the very small opening and at the same time peering over the tool itself as it blocks the view - ick. And as for the winder... I suppose if you are doing some heavy initial winding, it can get rather tiring twisting the tuner. But it is a tad big for tuner pegs on anything I used it on, so no nice &#34;tight&#34; fit, more of a &#34;jiggle&#34; fit. Plus the clearance needed to actually swing the thing around means having the instrument laying flat on a table doesn't help. Didn't even know there was a bridge pin puller on this thing. Just looked at it... guess that notch in the peg winder is it.Each time I have set out to use it, I end up turning my pegs manually and grimacing over the stiff action of the wire cutters while to align it on the string. I just recently ended up buying a set of Crescent Brand Miniature Cutters & Needle-Nose Pliers Set(the pliers are JUST the thing for pulling the strings and keeping tension while winding). When I have to redo my mothers acoustic guitar, I'll try the notch bridge peg puller. But other wise, this thing gets a serious two-star &#34;meh&#34;.
