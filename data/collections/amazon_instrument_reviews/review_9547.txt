Some of the stands I have purchased are hollow, some are solid (at the part that screws together to adjust the height of the stand). The hollow ones are a PITA because they are easier to strip and bend. All mic stand inventories I have bought from (budget lines) have this issue. I wish they would specify exactly what you are going to get in your box.
