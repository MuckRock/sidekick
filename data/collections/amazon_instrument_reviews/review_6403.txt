This is a excellent Snare Wire, used it to replace an old noisy snare wire that rattled on my old Pearl Snare Drum, quick and easy to replace, came with straps to secure but did not use them as I prefer string. Improved the snare sound by 100%, no more rattle, snare now has a very fat tight crisp sound, well made product that did the trick. Product came with simple clear to read instructions with pictures, if you follow the instructions your strand will work perfect. Great Product at a excellent price.
