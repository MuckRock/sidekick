I use this boom attached to a desk clamp to hold a talk back mic (a cheap SM58 wannabe from Radio Shack). I like how I can collapse and tilt back the boom so it is out of the way when not in use, but then I can  easily position for use with a generous 16 inch reach. Definitely cannot use this with a standard desk mic stand weighted base because of the tip risk, but a clamping mount works very well. The locking clutch is excellent, with a large nob and secure teeth. The smaller knob to control extending the boom is also more than sufficient. Just what I needed.
