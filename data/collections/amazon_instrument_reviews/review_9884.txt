Well, it's a solid chunk of metal.  The lights on it are either all on or all, off, so they are useless to me.You can power any lightweight 9v, 12, or 18v stompbox with this.  Just watch the milliamps because I don't think this can deliver much more than a few hundred per box.My only issue with it is that the included patch cords are all the same length.  Would have been nice to have a few really long ones.It is more expensive than a one spot, but I guess this is a neater solution and at the very least, I can actually use my all the stompboxes  I want now.
