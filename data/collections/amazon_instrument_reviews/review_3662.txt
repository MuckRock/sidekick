I bought one of these for each of my electric guitars (3) and really like them. They work great, were easy to assemble, and not expensive. I do think the name is a bit inapproriate because I would never use one on stage, I don't think they are sturdy enough. These are great if you don't have to worry about pets or children possibly bumping into them. I realize you won't normally have pets or children on stage, but sometimes there are people moving around and guitars do get knocked over. I recommend the On Stage XCG4 for home use or if you have a practice room where you know your guitar is safe. I use these primarily for electric guitars but also have one for an acoustic and it fits very nicely. Great deal for the very low price.
