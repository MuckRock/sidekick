I got this yesterday, and everything was alright, except that two of the three Mics worked. One was dead. I tested all three of them with the same, and different cable, and made sure that the the On/Off switch was on. It was first mic I tested of the three, and the dead one of the three. Everything was good except for that one Microphone.
