Delivery was Amazon fast, installation took all of 2 minutes and we were making music.  It has worked perfectly from the start and as continued without a flaw for the last 6 months, and we expect it to continue for years.  For the price you can't go wrong.  Mic sound is pristine, no noise, we use it for vocal recording in studio, run it off an M-Audio Mixer Keyboard which lacked Phantom power.  Top Recommendation.
