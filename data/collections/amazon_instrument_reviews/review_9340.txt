Wow, the capture quality of the internal mics is so bad it almost makes me cry, but plug in some real mics and voila- the DR-40 becomes something special.... But, I do not always want to carry around so much equpment, and was hoping for better internal mics.Honestly, my super cheap Olympus pocket recorder sounded better than this thing.And WHY is the line-out so darn noisy!? Must be defective. Oh well... Gonna, have to send this back.
