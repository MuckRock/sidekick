These locks are the only ones I use now, they are on all of my guitars and I put them on all I build. I have not had a guitar drop since I started using them, and have not read of anyone else having one drop either if it was attached. I have tried the Fender lock recently and although it is a great lock it is too large for me and my Schaller equipped straps will not fit them. I will stick with the Schaller in all 3 colors.
