Great little mixing console for home use and practice.I use it at home and sometimes take it on the road for small gigs where I need to connect my guitar, a pair of cordless mics and a portable electronic drum kit.This thing has phantom power just in case you didn't read that already!Overall I can say without hesitation that this unit is sturdy and packs all the necessary features you'd need and even has a british EQ to help shape your sound a bit.Cons? Not many... One gripe about this unit is that it has no power button! I mean what kinda electronic device comes without a power button these days huh? You have to disconnect the power adapter either from the power source or from the back of the mixer in order to take the device off. Apart from that the LED is wayyy too bright, so bright that you can't look at the device for very long and obviously can't make out the writing and control labels on the device. I notice all Behringer pedals come with this bright led. What I usually do is take a piece of tape and cover the led.I recommend getting this unit and only gave it 4 stars because of the few cons listed above.
