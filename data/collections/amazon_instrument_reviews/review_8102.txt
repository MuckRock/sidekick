I wasn't sure what to expect, and the foam rubber was a bit of a let down, especially when I took it from the plastic. Very strong fumes, not too pleasant, but they dissipated in the basement overnight.Because of the fumes I was a little concerned about what the material might do to a wood finish.  I was happy to see that there was no apparent smudging or marking after two hours.  I wouldn't leave it on anything "finished" for longer than that because this type of foam doesn't last forever and as it breaks down the residue can be hard to remove.  For now, it's great.It comes with a black nylon, sort of mesh tube shaped bag, good for putting it away or traveling.  For now I will just leave it as flat is possible so it doesn't curl so much.  For the size and utility, the price (which goes up and down) seems reasonable.
