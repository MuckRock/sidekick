Works better than straplocks as it doesnt fail like regular straplocks. I'd use it for lightweight guitars. Using this on a les paul will kill your shoulder. I always suggest this strap to "kids" who spin their guitars while on stage. This strap is the industry standard that will save your guitar from damage
