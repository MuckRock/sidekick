I have a hard time paying for a patch cable that costs almost as much as a 20' cable. These are not cheap but they are priced much better than others. And they Work Great! No loss of Tone through these cables. If anything I had to do some EQ adjusting because after using these I had a far greater signal (volume and frequency response) when I replaced my other patch cables with these!I Love Them!!!
