This came today and I must say that it surpassed my expectations greatly. My Takamine acoustic/electric fits perfectly and is VERY STABLE on the stand. I have 100% confidence this will NEVER tip over on its own. You'd have to be a total klutz to knock this thing over. Anyone with less than 4 or 5 stars must be a paid shill.This is built like a tank and should last a lifetime. It is adjustable (the neck) fully padded, and the two-arm base piece swivels for a custom fit. The stand takes 30 seconds to assemble and folds down for easy transport. A+++++++++++++
