D'Addario always comes through for the musician who wants a great product on the cheap. I've used boutique strings for many years, but always come back to these. Great tone, great string life (with a little maintenance) and very reasonably priced. Loved these as a replacement for the Fender Super Bullets that came on my USA Fender Standard Stratocaster.
