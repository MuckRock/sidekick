I'm pretty active on stage and have had problems with cable breakage for years. (I haven't found a wireless unit that I feel comfortable with on stage yet) I was usually replacing the cable connected to my guitar about every three to four months until I purchased these. At first I purchased one just to check them out, but after six months. I decided to replace all of my guitar cables with these. There just so well made and much cheaper than other high end cables too. They last forever! Definitely worth the money!
