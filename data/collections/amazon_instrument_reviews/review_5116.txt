I am both a bass player and a fidelity freak, always fussing over tone settings. This tiny amp packs BIG sound for everything from a harmonica to a keyboard .... and even my bass. The CD input has NO controls but is a very useful feature just the same. Having Behringer mics and a UB802 mixer, I banked on this being a good amp and was NOT disappointed. The 3-band tone controls do an excellent job of shaping sound to fit any instrument. No 15-watt amp will compete with live drums OR outdoor settings.... and do NOT expect 2 instruments to sound perfect together, but for indoor practicing and intimate small crowds, this amp will impress you. Every musician should have one of these around. Money well spent!
