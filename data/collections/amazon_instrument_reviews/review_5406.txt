I had a Line 6 POD that worked only on the computer and was great for effects and stuff but not the best for actually practicing away from the computer and decided it was time to change that. I considered a few different brands and even other Line 6 POD models. I even ordered a POD XT only to cancel that order when I realized that you can download tones from the Line 6 website and add them into the user memory banks for easy retrieval.As many have said, the batteries that come with it did not last long at all, but that was kind of expected. I have since been using Energizers and those are lasting long enough for my needs, plus I have a 9 volt AC adapter that works great, especially when I am recording.To use it for recording, simply output from the headphone jack to the input on your laptop or desktop computer and you'll be able to record with all the tones you could want! I downloaded a Joe Satriani sound and am so happy with it that I have already recorded myself playing one of his songs with it and it sounds great!I am not going to knock a star off for this since they obvously put a belt clip on it for a reason, but if you are like me and still like to sit it on a desk every now and then, it will not stay put by itself as it is not heavy enough, but I found that you can put two rubber bands on either side of it and it helps it to &#34;grip&#34; better and stay put so that it doesn't slide right off.I am very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend it to any guitarist out there who needs some great tones to practice with. I don't play live so I cannot say how well it would work for that.
