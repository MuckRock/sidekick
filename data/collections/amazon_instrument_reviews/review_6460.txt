I've been playing guitar for over 10 years and decided to take up ukulele as an extra little hobby.This one is pretty decent, especially at the price point. Not exactly the pinnacle of quality, but good enough to learn on and it comes with a case and a booklet with some basic songs and a chord chart. It doesn't seem to drop tuning enough to be too bad of a nuisance, but if I haven't picked it up for a few days it does need some tweaking.
