I kinda strayed away from the Elixir brand for a little while just "To See" if another brand would sound "better" and in doing so, I wasted time and money.(but I did get some EXPERIENCE) I'm back with the Elixirs now and have no intentions to "Experiment" any more.Simply put............Elixir makes the best Strings for an Acoustic Guitar that I've tried and I "Will Stick with them" because they have Great Sound, last a long time, easy to clean and prevent rust and/or corrosion.
