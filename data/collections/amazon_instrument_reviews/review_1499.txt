I get everything on Amazon now.  Need some strings and was ordering other stuff so bought to piggy back on shipping.  Elixir is what Tom Anderson uses and I trust his judgment.  He makes one of the finest guitars in the world if not the finest depending on what you like of course. Have a lot of them and used all kinds of other strings, I do Not like changing strings so these seem to last a decent amount of time.  Stretch them bend them and they don't break.  If your bending a couple steps or more then I would love to know what string holds up consistently.  Thanks much.
