My Les Paul is heavy.. The strap would constantly fall off. So I decided to get a set of strap locks. These installed in minutes, and really dont change the look of the guitar at all. You will need a nut driver to screw the lock to your strap. If you dont have locks on all your guitars, you cant interchange your straps easily any more, so I recommend getting them for all your guitars. The other added benefit I found is that on my hollow body the strap was actually scratching the back. With these locks the strap sits away from the guitar, so it fixes that problem as well. When I buy a new guitar, I get new locks. Are there better locks out there? I'm not sure, but Im committed now as I wanted the same locks on all my guitars.. Has never failed me yet.
