Ive Been Using This Item For about 3 weeks now, and I love it. I Have a homemade pedalboard, the one spot combo is good for it cause its kept me from having to mount a power supply on the board. I power 7 pedals and Absolutely no noise distortion comes from the pedals with this hooked up, If anything it sounds better than a battery, FOR SURE.
