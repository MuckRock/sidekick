A friend gave me a few of these and overall I like them.  I'd give them 3.5 stars if I could.  Having said that, I don't like them as much as a regular nylon pick.  The star hole just feels a bit weird to me, though I could probably get used to it.  I'm glad I got to try these, but these won't replace my favorite nylon picks.
