This is my second black suede leather strap I've bought from Levy's.  I love them.  The 2.5&#34; is wide and comfy.  The strap is soft.  I have had no issues with any residue or the straps falling apart.  They're high quality.  And they offer plenty of length adjustments, without any buckles or metal of any kind.
