I own several tuners, and two Snark-2 tuners, which are great (except they're not low profile like theKorg Pitchclip Chromatic Clip On Guitar Tuner - Korg PC-1--please see my review of that tuner).So, since I needed another tuner for my ukulele, I ordered this time a Snark-6.  This one says, specifically, for a ukulele.  I wanted to try it compared to the Snark-2Snark SN-2 All Instrument Clip-On Chromatic TunerThe Snark-6 and Snark-2 are identical, except for color.  The Uke tuner here is gloss black, and the Snark-2 is matte red.  Otherwise, the size of the dial/face, the clip itself is precisely the same.  So, there's nothing more ukulele relevant about the 6 versus the 2.  The tuning is chromatic, so it's good for any specific instrument (mandolin, guitar, uke, banjo, etc.).So, choose whichever color you prefer, and go for it.  Sweet tuner.  Superb graphics on the dial, colorful accurate, and inexpensive (but not "cheap" build, like the Korg).  Highly recommended tuner.
