pretty much this is a great case for the price but i would like more padding because i like my guitars to be safe but if you want a better case for protection invest in a hard case. i cant give it a bad review for not enough padding because this guitar has about the same amount of padding as most soft cases. this is also a pretty handsome looking case,if thats what you care about.
