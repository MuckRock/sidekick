Since this is the third hanger I have purchased it goes without saying that I really like it. My only criticism is that it ships with mounting hardware that is for a &#34;brick&#34; wall. I am fairly sure that 90%+ of those of us that use these hangers mount them on a plasterboard wall. How about shipping it with a suitable wall anchor for drywall? Otherwise, a great hanger that I trust for use with my expensive guitars.I'm just running out of wall space and money for new guitars.
