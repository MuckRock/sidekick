I've tried different kinds of headphones in the past and so far the Bose AE2 fits my taste. I've been using it for years when my son borrowed it a month ago and I'm pretty sure he has no intention of giving it back :) (Its the 5th headphone he borrowed) so I planned to buy another one but I said to myself why not try something different. After reading all the reviews on this product I finally decided to go for it. And WOW...i was blown away. I'm glad I tried something else. No regrets. This one really fits my taste. The clarity is superb and the bass is awesome.
