This little music stand folds up small enough (after some disassembly) to fit in a pouch less than 2 feet tall and 2 inches wide. Once assembled, it stands straight and is more than sturdy enough for sheet music or most softbound books. The height is adjustable so you should be able to find a comfortable position whether you're standing, seated on a stool or in a chair. The angle of the tray is not adjustable. The legs are simple flat metal pieces and could be susceptible to being bent if you trip over it, so this might not be the best stand if you plan to keep it in one location. But for a portable stand, it's hard to find fault with this one, especially given the low cost.
