I bought this boost to use in one specific situation. When playing a lead line with my bridge pick up with the tone knob all the way down, my volume drops quite dramatically. This boost does what it says it will do to remedy that, but it also seems to add a lot of noise. When the boost is off, my super high gain Fryette Deliverance 120 is very quiet when I just hold my hand over the strings. I'm using a 2010 LP Custom with a stock 490R pick up in the neck and 498T in the bridge. When I turn on the boost I immediately hear a lot of extraneous hissing and noise. When playing it isn't so bad, but I definitely am not used to so much extra noise. There are a couple of adjustment switches inside, and I haven't fooled with those yet, but I'm definitely going to do that. This boost will prob help guys with lower end gear get a better sound, but if you've already got pro quality stuff I don't see too much of an advantage here.
