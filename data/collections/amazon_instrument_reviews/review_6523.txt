This pedal board replaced a bcb6 boss case because I have a lot of non-Boss pedals and wanted to start using them for gigs.The PT2 footprint is large enough to accommodate a lot of pedals but not too big for a smaller gig, except some of the smallest "stages" (room corners) that do require a smaller rig.Without going into specifics there was a zipper issue on the soft case.  I wrote the company, described the problem.  Lizzie wrote back and said she'd take care of it. You just don't get better service than this company provides.  Combine that with the great product design and I'm a happy customer.The larger boards give you the option of installing a dedicated power supply underneath.  This is one of its best features.  Truly plug and play.  Yes, I spent more than I ever have on a pedal board before.  Portability.  Reliability.  Flexibility.  If I was ever going to use my best pedals for gigs, this was it.I have tried SKB and Furman and they have some nice features, if you like a lot of plastic.  I still like the PT2 much better.
