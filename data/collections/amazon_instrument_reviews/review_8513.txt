Shipping was fast! Got to me in two days! And it's a great midi controller! I use it for fl studio to make beats, I just plugged it in and I set a timer to get good timing ratios for it and it installed in 8.6 seconds flat and when I went in fl studio and selected it and tried it out with some sound kits but it was slow recognizing like I'd press the keys and it wouldn't recognize right away, then I remembered the asio drivers weren't activated, then I activated them and every key I'd press it would recognize immediately! Great buy! I hope if y'all get one! It's great and making beats is so much easier now then pressing the keys on the regular computer keyboard!
