My first Elec Guitar, I'm 60 years old, and this Guitar is PERFECT..If theirs better ones out there, then I can't wait to get one..I've got this one on a small 15 watt Amp, that's not a name brandAmp, and it sounds very good..So, needless to say I'm verrrrrrry happy, and love the blues and Jazz sounds I'm getting..B T W ...Who said learning the guitar was difficult..Piece of Cake, if u practice..Buy this Guitar, u won't be sorry you did..EnjoyJawbone
