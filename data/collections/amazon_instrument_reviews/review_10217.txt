My daughter is learning how to play and the .11 - .48 string set on my strat are giving her a literal pain.I put a set of the D'Addario NYXY0942 strings on my backup guitar and tuned it up. Usually, I've had issues when bringing some brands of strings up to pitch, but the D'Addario's seemed to do a much better job. I nearly always stress the higher pitch strings a bit before bringing them up to their final pitch and they stabilized quickly. The wound strings also seem quite stable. Frequently, it takes up to a couple of days for some strings to settle in, but I've seen no such issues with the D'Addario's.I usually use thicker strings on my guitars to get a fatter tone, but I was impressed by the sound of these in spite of them being much thinner than I usually like.My daughter is also very happy with them since they're not quite so tough on her fingers.
