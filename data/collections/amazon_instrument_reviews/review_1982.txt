Yeah, the strings that it came with were terrible, but it's an amazing guitar. I'll admit I bought it because it was cheap so I could practice playing on it and not have to worry about it becoming damaged, but it sounds great and plays really well. I like how the wood finish isn't all slick, has a nice natural feel to it.
