i originally wanted the Boss DD, but after doing a side by side demo, i decided that i'm not Buckethead and don't need a 150 dollar pedal just to do some intro stuff now and then. I have the Berhinger Reverb Machine and HellBabe and they do equal if not.....no they do equal to my Boss counterparts. Especially if you are looking for a unique sound that isn't stock Boss. i wouldn't take these on the road or anything without 3 or 4 backups, but for recording and doing demos Behinger is the way to go, timed effects wise anyway. they are made of plastic after all.
