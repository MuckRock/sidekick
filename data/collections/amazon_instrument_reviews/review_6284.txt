This seems to be a nice, rugged stand.  Much better than the one I received with a guitar I ordered.  It went together fast and is well padded.  It cradles my guitar well and seems to be solid.  I'm not sure how much I will use it now I have discovered guitar wall hangers, or string swings.  I prefer hanging them on the wall and not having them on the floor in the way, just my preference.I suppose these would be good for mic night or doing a gig, but I don't expect that will ever be something I do unless I get a lot better than I am now.  I still suck....but I'm having fun and trying.
