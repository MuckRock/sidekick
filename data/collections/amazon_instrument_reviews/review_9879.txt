Very versatile power supply and much cheaper than others.  This is not true isolated outputs, but it is quiet and that is what counts.  I have the Fuel Tank Chameleon and I end up using this because it fits the needs of the pedals on my board the best, mainly because of the 500ma output. Here is a comparison of the JP-02, Chameleon, and the OneSpot.  I have all three.T-REX FUEL TANK CHAMELEON (1350ma)Outputs 1-3: 9v/12v 300maOutput 4: 9v/18V 150maOutput 5: 9v/12v 300ma| ---- Use 5 OR 6 only, not bothOutput 6: 12v AC 300maJOYO SP-02 (1000ma)Outputs 1-7: 9v 100maOutput 8: DC 9V Maximum output of 500mAOutput 9: DC12V 100maOutput 10: DC18V 100maVISUAL SOUND ONESPOT (1700ma 9v only)Daisy Chain Power into 8 pedals not exceeding 1700ma
