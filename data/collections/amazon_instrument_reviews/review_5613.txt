Well long story short this is my fourth Vox wah. Others have come and gone, some have been around longer than others but this one is the newest so im still working with it. sounds like the classic v847 but has the ac plug on it, that will come in handy. not as versatile as the JS big bad wah but far less complex and less likely to have issues with dust and dirt. it has a wide sweep and killer tone but im still looking for that sweet spot that gives that wah'o sound when doing solo work. so far so good not perfect but good.
