I've been wanting a pitch vibrato pedal for a while but didn't want to spend $350-$500 for an old boss vb-2(which this pedal sounds exactly like) so i looked at this which I didn't really know what to expect but when I got it I was amazed by it, it sounds really good. It maybe less durable than a metal pedal but who cares for this price I wouldn't mind buying a new one if mine broke and considering there is hardly any companies that actually make pitch vibrato's(uni-vibe/Vibe pedals are not pitch vibrato pedals)buying a new one isn't a problem.
