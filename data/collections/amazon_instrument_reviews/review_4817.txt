I was looking for a low cost mixer to use with my Fostex MR-8 recorder and did a little research on the XENYX 802.  Just looking at it with it's inputs, number of controls, I would have guessed it cost close to a couple hundred bucks. Imagine my surprise when, after reading the positive reviews, that I discovered this thing was only [...]!  I bought it immediately and, right out of the box, it did exactly everything I was expecting it to - this is a awesome little piece of gear for getting the recording control and flexibility that is not inherent on the Fostex. I'm quite excited about my future recordings using the 802 - I'm like a kid with a new toy!  Highly recommended piece of gear that is an extremely great value for the cost.
