I have a Taylor 514 ce acoustic guitar and Elixir Strings are what this very nice guitar came with from Taylor when new.  I figure they have done the research on what works best and I see no reason for a change other than going fro the extra light strings to the light weight strings.  The sound you get with the Nanoweb strings are amazing and they enhance the results from an already great guitar.  They also last a long time before they go dead.
