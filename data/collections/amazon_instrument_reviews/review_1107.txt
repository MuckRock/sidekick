I bought this mic after hearing good things about it, but I had never tried it. It has impressed me quite a bit since then. I use it in a small home studio set-up, along with a Presonus Firebox and Logic Pro on a Macbook.For the price, this mic is a very good deal. It sounds much better than an Audio Technica 3035 that I had (and ended up selling shortly after getting this mic). I also got an Oktava MK-319 that is a much more expensive mic, and that was then sent to be mod'ed by Michael Joly (and therefore cost even more) and I'd say the two mics are very similar. I end up using the CAD M179 a lot more because it's less valuable, but sounds just as good.What else? It has low noise and combines the crispness you want from a condenser without being unpleasant. It sounds particularly great for male vocals, in my opinion, although I have used it for as a room drum-mic. I would highly recommend this mic, especially at this price point.
