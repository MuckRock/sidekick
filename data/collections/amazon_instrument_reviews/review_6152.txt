Some have complained that it's construction is not the best. I actually had to send the first one back because it did not work. But a new one came the day after I lodged a request for a replacement.It's a very simple echo device, I use just to give my guitar a little bounce. I prefer to play 'dry' most of the time so as to define better what I'm doing. But some solos need a little filling, and this keeps it subtle. It can do a lot more, but it's what I wanted.Sturdy enough, well priced, and simple to use.
