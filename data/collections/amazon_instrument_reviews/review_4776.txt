The hardware works as advertised and is easy to operate.  Make sure you have a good microphone to use with it.  The Cubase software also works well but the user interface and instructions are more complex that you might wish for.  That seems to be a common problem with music recording programs I've seen - heavy reliance on technical jargon that may be unfamiliar to the typical amateur singer/guitarist.  This should come with a good &#34;how-to-use&#34; course that helps the user learn the jargon and common applications.
