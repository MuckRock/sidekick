Great pedal- very lush and usable tones. Think "Lightning Crashes" by the band "Live". Ok, I was going to initially give it 4 stars because of the following reasons:  plastic knobs, foot switch does not 'click', very miniscule volume drop with engagement (actually, I moved the pedal to a different spot in my signal chain and I *think* that resolved the volume issue, but I can't tell-  I guess if it is too close to tell, then it's a non issue !). Then I performed a reality check on myself and looked at the price again.  Metal enclosure.  Works like a charm.  Twenty four tax free bucks and free shipping.  It gets 5 stars because there is nothing even close at this price.
