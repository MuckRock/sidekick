Cheaply made and thin leather leave a lot to be desired. At least it's long enough for even the lowest slung of guitar postures. This should accomadate a bass as well due to the extra length.I am comparing it to $10 guitar center straps which have double leather ends which are much sturdier than the ones on this Ernie Ball strap, which are thin and single ply. I wouldn't trust this strap without a strap lock.
