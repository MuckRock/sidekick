The Mustang 1 was a great buy for another great Fender product.  It has more bells and whistles than I can mention but it's sophistication is lost on me.  I was looking for a clean crisp sound with little or no distortion and with the Mustang it seemed that's all I was getting.  Great little amp, just not for me.
