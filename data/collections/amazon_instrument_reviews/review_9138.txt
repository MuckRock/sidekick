Broke one of my Snark tuners when I kept it on a guitar while putting it in the case to take to a gig and decided I needed a tuner I could keep on any guitar while it was in any case.Pros:- Fits on any guitar- ...which then fits in any case- Cheap- AccurateCons:- Calibration button and on/off button are same shape, same size, and on the same tiny surface. Very easy to hit the wrong one.- Not great (poor viewing angle) for 3-on-a-side tuners (works better for 6 in-line tuners)- Not as easy to read as the SnarkOther thoughts:I only use this on a guitar that I play for only one song at shows (because the song requires two capos and a detuned string, don't ask.) I much prefer the Snark, but apparently I can't be bothered to remember to remove a tuner before putting my toys away. Idiot. At shows I rely on a tu-2 stompbox for tuning. Basically, this is a niche tuner. It's so stinking small and that's what counts.
