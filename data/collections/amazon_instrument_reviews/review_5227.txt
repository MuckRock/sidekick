The strings on my new Yamaha FG700S were too hard and noisy so I ordered these and what a difference in the feel!  Playing went from painful to pure pleasure!  I did notice that the tone of the low E string was a bit dead, especially in drop D tuning so I put that one Yamaha string back on and got better sounding lows.  For that, I gave four stars instead of five.
