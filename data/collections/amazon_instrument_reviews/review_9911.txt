I've just replaced the original, plastic nut on my new Squier Strat guitar with this one.I had to file it down slightly to fit the slot and set the string height that I wanted but this was simple to do using a single flat metal nail file.I was shocked at how much 'brighter' the guitar sounded with only this single change!Even my wife who claims to have a tin ear, commented on how much clearer it now sounds.Also, the shipping time warning was a bit over exaggerated. My piece arrived in a week (thank you very much!).For the low price, I think this will improve the sound of your guitar (safely) more than any other upgrade.
