It is so small and cute and totally fits my guitar with and without the bag. So if it is outside the bag of course I can showcase my guitar. The guitar inside the bag fits perfectly too. It stands as it should and it was a snap (literally) to set up it was like three steps or something. Wow. I am very impressed considering the price!!!!
