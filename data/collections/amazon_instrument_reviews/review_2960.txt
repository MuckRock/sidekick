They sound great. They helped revive an old acoustic guitar that had been buried in a closet for years (along with a very thorough cleaning). I don't have any opinion on the "feel" of these strings like some reviewers. I honestly didn't notice anything different. I bought them because I wanted great strings on an old cheap guitar in order to get the best sound possible. These strings did that just fine. The guitar now sounds great. Job completed.
