it's semi-secure on carpeting or hard floor, but all together I am pretty unsatisfied with this stand. The bottom piece has no way to lock in place, and although with the guitar on it it is more stable, I am not comfortable enough risking my wonderful guitar to something rather flimsy...I prefer the one that is mounted on the wall as more stable overall. This one? Meh. Not worth the purchase in my opinion... booooooooo.
