D'Arrario does sell some fine strings.  While these are not my very, very favorites (strictly because I prefer a slightly lighter gauging on light strings), they still do just fine--much better than some other brands I've tried.  I would not hesitate to buy them again.  Good-sounding and playing all-around strings.
