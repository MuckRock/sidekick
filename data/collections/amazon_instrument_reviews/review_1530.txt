These Elixir Nanoweb acoustic guitar strings are amazing because they sound like new strings for a long time (months) unlike other guitar strings.  Great product.  These Extra Light strings are not light enough for my playing enjoyment, so instead I buy Elixir Nanoweb strings in singles so I can select the gauges that I like even better.  A great product no matter what gauge string you choose.
