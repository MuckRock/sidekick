I ordered this bench for last Christmas (2005). I'm satisfied so far. Good value for money.The seat is generously padded and is 2.5 inches thick. Padding material is not too soft, and that is good in my opinion.All-steel frame construction feels sturdy.Contrary to one of the reviews, my bench came with height adjustment (it is not on-the-fly kind of thing, though). Each of the legs has 3 holes (low, middle, high). A fixing bolt goes through one of the holes for both of the legs, and the bolt becomes the crossing point of "X". Three positions roughly correspond to 18, 19 and 20 inches.For changing height, all you have to do is to loosen and remove the fixing bolt, insert it into whichever hole you like and then tighten it. Don't worry, you don't need any tool to do the job,  thanks to a large plastic knob. See the picture and you'll understand how it works.Mine initially came with middle position. I also tried high and low, but set it back to middle. It seems to be a good compromise for my family, as the bench is used daily by me, my wife and my kids. Sure it's nicer if you can change the height quickly and easily. However, with this price, I wouldn't complain at all.
