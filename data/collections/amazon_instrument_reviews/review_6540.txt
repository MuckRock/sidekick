Amazing! I plugged this little gadget into my Strat, put on my headphones and wow I was super surprised! The sound is amazing. You can adjust the amount of gain and volume to fine tune your sound whether your playing through humbuckers or single coils. I love the sound I get on either my Strat or Les Paul. Best of all you can practice as loud as you like without bothering anybody. I plug this little monster into my compressor and from the compressor to the guitar and the sound is amazing. I really like the sound and the fact that it is totally portable and independent of power (runs on two AAA batteries). The digital delay effect is activated independently, (same little switch just one extra click) which is fine, but you can't adjust the speed or mix. That's OK though because the factory setting works just fine if you want a touch of delay. All in all, I highly recommend this Vox AmPlug Lead Guitar Headphone Amp for its sound and price. One small con, its made of plastic and seems a bit fragile.
