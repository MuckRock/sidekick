Hands down the best cable I have ever owned. I was spending money on cheaper cables continuously and now I spend that money on other stuff. I play one to five hours a day and have used this same cable for 3 or 4 months. Well worth the money. Lifetime guarantee to boot. Definitely will buy Mogami from now on.
