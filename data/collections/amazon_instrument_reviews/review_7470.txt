Indeed, this little blue-lighted wonder will make you famous. Not unlike the &#34;Three Wolf Moon&#34; shirt, this little pedal will get you the ladies (or if you're a lady, it will likely get you the guys). Either way, it gets you what you want! On top of that, it does a great job of boosting your signal from your guitar and getting you just a bit of &#34;oomph&#34;. In particular, I find it helpful when I'm running a lower output guitar through a long cable. Did I mention it has a blue light? The only downside is that you have to open up the back (with a screwdriver, so put that on your shopping list if you don't have one) to adjust the little switches that chance the tone.
