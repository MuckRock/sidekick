We bought three of these and they are just great. Mounting holes are drilled right, screws pass right through and fit perfectly. Comes with big, beefy drywall anchors and feels just right. Holds the guitar out at a safe distance. Highly recommend this over the other (way cheaper looking) ones that are a few bucks less. Spend the extra few bucks on these and SMILE.
