MY THUMB GOT SORE!  I HADN'T PLAYED ANY OF MY STRING INSTRUMENTS FOR SOME TIME.  THE FINGER TIPS ON MY LEFT HAND WERE NO LONGER CALLUSED AND MY RIGHT UKULELE STRUMMING THUMB WAS TENDER FROM BEING OUT OF PRACTICE.  HENCE MY PURCHASE OF THESE FELT PICKS.  THE PICKS ARE FINE.  THEY ARE USEFUL.  MY ONLY COMMENT IS THAT I REALLY LIKE A FELT PICK THAT IS THICKER AND A LITTLE SOFTER.  THESE ARE GOOD BUT DIFFERENT.
