I was so excited to discover that you can buy these on their own. I am a huge devotee of Dunlop strap locks -- having dropped both my electric guitar and my bass on stage at one time or another, I have now installed these on all my main performing guitars.So it was a given that when I started gigging with a new bass, I would put strap locks on it. But I already have my fancy bass strap decked out with the lock mechanisms, so I really only needed these buttons. I was on the verge of resigning myself to buying the whole set again and throwing the extra strap lock parts into a drawer when I found these. Buying the buttons alone cost less than half what the whole set would have, and now I can just shuttle my one bass strap between both instruments.I did have some major difficulty getting one of the two screws all the way tightened, but since I have attached strap lock buttons at least four other times and it was easy as pie, I'm more inclined to blame my instrument for that.Great product. I'm elated to know I can now get these buttons separately.
