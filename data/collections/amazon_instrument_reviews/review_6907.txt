Have been a user of Jazz III picks lately (Max Grip version:Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks - 6 Pack) but was having some difficulty with those picks during rhythmic sections that required lots of strumming.Was recommended to these picks by other users so I gave them a shot. A few of my notes:- This pick is very slightly bigger than the Jazz iiis i linked above. I like this a lot. The tip is almost exactly the same size, but the top grip area is ever so slightly bigger. Still, these picks are significantly smaller than your "average" size pick.- The rubber grip area is a joy to hold. Very comfortable, very stable, lots of grip- If you didn't know, Dava picks dont come in varying thickness. They are instead "control" picks. Meaning depending on where you grip the pick it will become more or less rigid. Look at the picture --- see those three horizontal lines in the middle of the pick? Those are reference markers --- choke up on the pick (lowest line near the tip) for leads and pull back for more flexible strumming. This will take me some time to get used to but it is pretty nice in theory. However, even choking up on the pick, it is not as rigid as the jazz iiis and sometimes for fast work I was wishing I was still holding the jazz iii.- These Dava Jazz come in three colors: Red (Delrin material), Yellow (Nylon material), Orange (Gel). Different materials produce different sounds/feels. Also, in my opinion, the gel is a little harder than the other two.Hope this review helped
