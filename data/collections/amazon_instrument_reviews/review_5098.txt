I initially thought that these would be very wimpy sounding. I was wrong. They have a great tone with my metal distortion pedal. I have a Schecter Hellraiser with EMG X Series pickups and they go great with them. They are easier to bend too which is great. I no longer use heavier strings like I use too. These will be my mainstay.
