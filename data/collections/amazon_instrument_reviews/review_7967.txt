This is my 3rd set of cables I ordered from Amazon. I needed a lengthy cable for my requirement so ordered this one. The finish  is not bad on the outer PVC layer and coated zinc alloy body. Works fine with my mixer. My previous set of cables ( totally 4 cables) , each one of them develop some kind of problem after few months exactly on the same spot. I guess the inner strings somehow gets broken and stops working. I would see how this goes and update the review. If this one also would result in same condition, I would look for something better. The only reason I ordered the same ones again and again was because of the pricing. They are not expensive to replace.
