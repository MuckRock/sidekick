These stands are just what I wanted for my studio. I like them so much, that I own five. I like the easy access to my guitars for recording sessions, and I like being able to look at them too. The multiple guitar stands are probably safer for the stage and more economical with space, but these stands are perfect for me as I don't gig much anymore. I'm very happy with the solid build. Good, solid guitar stand.
