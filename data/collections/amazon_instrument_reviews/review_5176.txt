Surprised really. For the price I dont think I could have done better. Nice case, come with stand adapters, and make me sound pretty good and I cant really sing. Dropped one a few times and its still working. Good feel/weight. On /off switches on each. I record to DAW and the recordings sound fine. I usually run everything through a BBE so that might be part of why I am pleased with them but I do recocmmend these for mics in this price range.
