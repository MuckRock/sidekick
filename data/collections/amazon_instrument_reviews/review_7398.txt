I already owned two of these Tuners previously & purchased these for friends. They are great for jamming with friends & are so user friendly & accurate. What is really impressive is that they can stay attached to the headstock of my guitar whileplaying making touch up tuning a breeze. I love mine & so do my friends. In my opinion for the price they are hard to beat.
