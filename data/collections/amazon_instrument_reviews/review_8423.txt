Peterson makes some of the best and most accurate tuners and their high end strobe tuners are a must for the professional guitar repair shop allowing for accurate intonation and set ups. This tuner is accurate and I have even successfully set the intonation on a couple of my instruments using it (although it is not intended for this purpose). However I purchased it for the intention of taking it along to gigs in my guitar case. Unfortunately, due to the flimsy plastic construction I don't feel that it is up to the task and it would only be a matter of time before it gets broken if taken out of the house or on the road. Far better off purchasing a cheap Snark tuner that if lost or broken wouldn't be a big deal to replace and is accurate enough for most peoples use.
