I originally purchased the large size and found it to be a bit too big, thus I wanted to try the medium. It's much smaller than the large, but it fits my fingers well (I'd say I have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy). The glass is pretty thin, so it is not as sturdy as the large, but I think it should last a while. As long as you don't drop it all the time, it should be ok. Definitely recommend this slide (especially for its price).
