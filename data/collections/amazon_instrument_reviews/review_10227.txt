I've used D'Addario strings for years and they never fail me. These extra light are great for playing lead as they're easy to bend and feel great on your fingers. As they are extra light strings, they serve limited purposes but as for tone quality it is very smooth and clear. For a brand as a whole i'd recommend D'Addario strings to any guitarist and for gauge it's really dependent on play-style and role if you are in a group.
