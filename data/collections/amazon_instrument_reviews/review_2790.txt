I have to start off by saying this cable does not produce the same sound quality of my Mogami Gold cables.  If you are recording and are going to meticulous about your sound, this might not be the cable for you.HOWEVER, for the price and purpose this a five star cable.  The plastic plug ends relieve stress on the connection, but also feel sturdy and secure.  The gold plating ensures a solid connection.What I like most about this cable is that it's guaranteed for life and I can bring it to a Planet Waves authorized dealer for a replacement... or so their packaging claims.  I have not had to replace mine.
