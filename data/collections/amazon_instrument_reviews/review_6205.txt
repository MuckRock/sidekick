I literally just took this pedal out of the box an hour and a half ago and it has already blown me away. I've only begun to scratch the surface of what this pedal can do, and i've made funky/weird loops of sound, bizarre cricket noises, long delays that instead of fading out actually get LOUDER with time. I dont know how else to say it, If you are looking for a delay pedal, you just found it. This thing can do anything.It feels like the iPhone of delay pedals to me so far... like it can do all this crazy cool stuff... but oh yeah, it can also just do an echo too. (Wait, you can call people with an iPhone?)I could have waited a week or so to really learn everything this pedal can do and write a detailed review of it's performance, but i dont feel i have to. It's the latest BOSS delay pedal... what else is there to say?Also with the price range of 130-160 dollars its a huge bargin compared to other BOSS pedals that might pull off a similar effect such as the RC-2($180-200), or RC-20XL($240-300). Granted i know very little about the FULL capabilities of those pedals, but the DD-7 has up to 40 seconds worth of loop play in "Hold" mode. And the hold mode is so much more sophisticated that what I am familiar with... since previous to this pedal i have only tampered with the DD-3.Sorry if I'm rambling, but seriously I'm in love with this pedal. Perhaps i will post a video demo of some of the weird junk you can do with it at some point.
