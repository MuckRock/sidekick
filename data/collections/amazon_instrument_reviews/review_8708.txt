This product is worth having if, like me, you find yourself needing a place to quickly "park" your guitar without putting it back in the guitar stand. I use it on a desk next to my chair and music stand. Works great -- only suggestion I have it to perhaps make a version with a sticky tape underside, or a way of semi-permanently attaching it the spot where you want it so it doesn't move around. I wound up using a very small wood screw to attach it to my desk so it stays fixed. Overall -- I like it.
