This is a really solid table mic stand, and you're not going to find a better price (I looked). The base is solid and heavy, and the actual stand is a sturdy metal tube. I liked the first one enough that I ordered a second. I should note, though, that it does not come with the pictured adapter for smaller mic clips, which I can imagine being disappointing even though it didn't affect me.
