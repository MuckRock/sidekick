I have both this tuner and a Snark for each of my instruments.  Though I am not a professional musician, I find each them to be of equal accuracy.  In fact, the D'Addario's compact size and fit is totally un-noticeable and though its screen is micro in size, it is very clear and viewable denoting flat/sharp notation.  A great choice for the price.
