I have one one these from the 80's back home, and when I was looking for a new peddle, I found this was still the best around. I remember searching for the right peddle back in the 80's and going through dozens of them before settling on the Rat. And it's exactly the same... Simple, sturdy and its settings are perfect from crunch to blistering distorted sustain. I run it through all manner of amps - including Marshalls, Vox, and even Crate, both tube and transistor, and with a few quick easy adjustments I get exactly what I'm looking for no matter the box.I'm an old school player - meaning I want my sound to come from the guitar and amp instead of processors. This is just an enhancement to my sound, and not the basis of it... though I expect anyone will get what they want from this baby.
