Just like the last reviewer, I also use this to link my MXR/Dunlop pedals together. They are surprisingly well made and I dont notice any signal distortion or drop off in sound at all. No cracklies, nada. I have been well pleased with these and will continue using planet waves cords. They are solid, durable, and reliable (and cheap as well).Enjoy!
