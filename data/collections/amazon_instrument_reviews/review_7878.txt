Let me preface this review by saying that I am not a professional musician, but I have some experience with guitar amplifiers and sound reinforcement equipment. I bought this amp for a couple of reasons- I wanted a combo that was light in weight, easy to move,store, and carry, and also was clean sounding and slightly loud. I can get the sound level I want out of this amp without turning the volume knob up more than 1/4, but if I ever want more, there's plenty of headroom there. It is definitely a clean, noise-free amp at moderate sound levels, and I can add effects through my Line6 Pod Pro if I want to, like more drive, reverb, etc.. As far as durability goes, I've only had it for a day, so I can't say. It has a year warranty period. Price through Musiciansfriend was good, I buy everything for music through them( no offense to Amazon). It's solidly built . All in all, a beautifully designed and executed product. Thanks, ZT!Update- 3/1/12 So far, so good! I've played through the amp for a couple weeks now, and it's great. Clean, low noise, I'm used to the controls and love the sound of it. No need to even use my Pod Pro. I'm now thinking of adding an extension speaker cab of my own design, using Eminence Designer software and an Eminence Commonwealth 12" guitar speaker. Also considering the Lunchbox extension cab. I don't really need more volume but a 12" speaker might change the sound enough to where I like it, although I like the sound through the 6.5" speaker it comes with. Always experimenting with my sound. To think some people buy $2000 tube amps, wow I'm not that kind of expert!Update- 3/10/12 I hooked the amp up to a JBL PA cab, and it really rocked! The JBL 15" woofer in the cab had a lot more bass, so I adjusted the ZT tone to give the signal more treble to compensate. Hooking up an external speaker is definitely a way to get more volume if so desired. Now thinking about an Eminence Deltalite 12" neodymium speaker in a 1 cu. ft. As an extension speaker.
