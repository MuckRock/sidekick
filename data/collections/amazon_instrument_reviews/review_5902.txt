Got the black one.  Bought this to help hold up my heavy Sheraton II and needed something at least 2 inches wide and strong to do it.  On that level this strap succeeds. It is definitely strong enough to keep my guitar from falling off or shifting on my shoulder.  It also looks very nice.But any positive thoughts I have about it are outweighed by the constant shedding of black dyed leather that continually falls off the strap and onto me, my guitar, my carpets, etc.I need things like guitar straps to be ready to USE without causing a shower of little leather bits all over the place!  I am not sure how long this will go on but I've been using it for two weeks now and there is a trail of small black leather wherever I go.  I have not encountered the dye running yet.Honestly if I had it to do over, I would skip this particular strap. Suede and me are not getting along too well at the moment.
