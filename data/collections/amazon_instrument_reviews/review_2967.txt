I automatically put these on any guitar I own as soon as I buy it, I change strings and toss those white plastic pins.  Makes any guitar look so much classier!  I swear there is a slight increase in the richness of the tone too!  Phenominal value,  tons of bang for the buck  They look SOOOO good on there...  Installed easily in 3 different guitars so far.
