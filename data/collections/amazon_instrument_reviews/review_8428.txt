This microphone only records in mono, and if you're unsure of what that means, it doesn't capture sound to it's full potential, and doesn't create a left/right feeling. All recordings sound like it is coming from just one direction, and though this is useful for some things such as podcasts, I wouldn't recommend it to a musician looking for great voice quality. It looks nice, and it would b e great for a Skype call, but it really wasn't what I was expecting when i opened the box up and tested it out. If you're looking for a mono microphone, this is however a very good mono microphone.
