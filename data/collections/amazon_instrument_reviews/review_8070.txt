For any usable tones while playing live, the best bet is to plug it into a tube power amp. Direct to mixer or running it through a solid state amp is very uninspiring.I didn't like the recorded tones either, much rather preferred Amplitube 3 if micing a real tube amp wasn't an option.That being said, it is good for practice and song writing. Used this for more than a year and finally sold it! That's the other thing with items like this, they lose value real quick once the next version comes out.
