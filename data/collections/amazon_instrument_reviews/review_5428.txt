Works like a champ.  I only have four pedals on it thus far, but I haven'te had any problems.  No noise issue, no "brown outs" because the power supply couldn't handle the load.  I still have open leads for those other pedals...(smile).  My power strip now has more space for other "toys" to make my weak playing sound better.
