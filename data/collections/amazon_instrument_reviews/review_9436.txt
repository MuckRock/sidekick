I got this because of the price. As soon as I opened it, the first thing I noticed was that it feels like it's not too sturdy. I don't know if it's going to last me a while. But, it does its job. Works fine on some guitars. The neck has to be thinner, though. I have to be careful when I put it on, as well as when I remove it. I'd pay for a better one if I had to get another.
