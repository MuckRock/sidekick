My wife & myself are a Celtic duo and a number of our shows are at renaiessance fairs where no visable pa equipment is allowed. We considered a wireless to use with a battery powered Crate Taxi which could easily be hidden but most wireless receivers need a power outlet & at these events no power is available. When I saw this at the price offered  and that both the mic transmitter and the receiver were battery powered I thought it was worth a try. In the past we had a problem keeping an audiance because at some events where the natural acoustics are less than stellar they just plain couldn't hear the stories in the songs. We use this to give our voices a small, unobvious boost. It kind of has the effect of adding a tweeter to a speaker in that it gives our voices the clairity to be understood. The result has been that audiances now stay for the entire show, laughing at the comedy, crying at the tragedy.  Our tips & cd sales have gone WAY up. Is it high fidelity? Quite simply, no. But in our case it works beautifully. Recommended, just remember the price point and you won't be disappointed.
