I hadn't thought about it before buying these bridge pins, but metal pins apparently add a bit of brilliance to the tone of my Alvarez-Yairi guitar, so it's a great bonus!  I bought them because my original plastic bridge pins were snapping and I didn't like the plastic ones available at a local music store. I'm very happy I bought them!
