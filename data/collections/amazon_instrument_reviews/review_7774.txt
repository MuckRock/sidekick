I purchased a set of Fender Vintage Tremelo Tension Springs in order to "beef up" the tremelo tension on an inexpensive Squier Jagmaster guitar that I recently purchased.  These springs clearly are better and more consistently made than the springs that came on the Jagmaster (the loop actually goes all the way around, which is not the case with the springs that came on the guitar) and it seems that they are of a higher tension. Highly recommended as replacement springs, or to supplement the three springs that come on less expensive guitars.
