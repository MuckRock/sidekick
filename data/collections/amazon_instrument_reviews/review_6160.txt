This is hands down the best delay pedal I have ever used. I owned a Boss DD-3 for many years and I have tried various other brands, but this little beauty takes the cake. The delay is pure analog so it produces a smooth and creamy sound. It is very easy on the ears in both clean and distorted settings, and it adds exponentially to your tone. When turned off it is true bypass, which means it does not color your guitar's natural tone in any way. I recognized a notable difference when I unhooked my DD-3 and plugged in the Carbon Copy.The pedal is slightly smaller than most pedals but it is built like a tank. The price point is a little expensive but, in this instance, you get what you pay for. If you're looking for a creamy, true bypass, analog pedal then look no further. The Carbon Copy is the best there is!
