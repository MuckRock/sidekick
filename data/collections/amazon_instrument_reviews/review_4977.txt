I'm reviewing this after spending a couple or so hours trying to get this to work with my Behringer 802 Xenyx mixer, and I finally did after nearly throwing in the towel.  Turns out I was using my mixer's CD/Tape switch incorrectly, thus getting very poor results or excruciating feedback.  I finally went on You Tube and found a Behringer guy that has a video that's less than 2 minutes in length and he had the unit hooked up to a mixer and computer.  Just taking a look at the that video made me realize it was something simple I was doing wrong - I was over-thinking it. Once I got it to working correctly, I could not believe the results once everything was dialed in correctly, including the control on my PC that controlled the recording volume for this unit.  So, now I'm looking forward to doing some real recording with it, using Audacity as my main recording software. (Edit: I did some recording with this dealie over the weekend and was really, really pleased with the results - I can hardly wait to do some more recording with this. So, to the arrogant salesman who bad-mouthed this at a local music chain store and tried to sale me a $150.00 Lexicon unit, I won't be needing that - I'm quite happy with this little interface, thank you very much. And to everyone else, don't forget that you can keep this thing hooked up to your PC and use it to simply listen to music on your hard drive and it will sound a lot better than your stock on-board sound card.  Thanks Behringer, this is a great value!!
