I installed this in a Super Champ x2.  As others have pointed out you'll have to turn the treble down after installing it.  That's because it's designed for making solos stand out. I.e., for adding punch.  If you're a lead guitarist, this speaker will make your guitar sing.However, if you mostly play rhythm, I'd stick with the stock speaker.I want to put two of these into my 4x10 Blues DeVille to increase its range and make solos sing, while letting the stock speakers give me some bottom.
