I must say, in the beginning I was not thrilled with the product.  The coloring that it adds is relatively subtle unless cranked, however after using it for several weeks then not using it, I did notice a difference.  I found that using it as a gain input to the distortion pedal results in some very warm sweet sounding crunch :-)  very nice.  The type of coloring is available through a dip switch, which I guess is ok.  Not highly accessible though.  All in all this has stayed in my effects chain between the wah wah and the distortion box.  I normally leave it on and use the stomps available on my distortion pedal.  No plans to remove.
