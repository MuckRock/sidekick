I've tried leather straps, I've tried Rocksteady straps, I still keep coming back to this strap. It's steady, Highly adjustable. And it works very nicely with the Dunlop Dual Design Straplok system. Good job Ernie Ball! I even prefer this to a nice Levy's strap that I own because the Ernie Ball strap is a bit slipperier
