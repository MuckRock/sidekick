Wrestling the guitar in and out of the case when you want to practice is inconvenient.  This stand allow for a reasonably safe place to store a guitar when it is out of the case.  It even has a band across the neck of the guitar to keep it in the rack. I like it as a safe stoage place as well as the ease it offers to grab my guitar and practice for a few minutes.  It is a reasonably well made rack at a very good price.  It is much safer to have my guitar in this rack than laying about in the house waiting for someone to step on my guitar.update: January 7, 2013...  liked the first one so much I got two more for my other two guitars.  I love being able to pick up one of the three and do a few licks.  Each one is different and now they are all three out of the their cases and at my fingertips.  The price is right and they keep them safely stored.
