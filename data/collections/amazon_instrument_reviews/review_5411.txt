Like many guitar players, I have a few effects pedals of different brands and I needed an alternative to nine volt batteries to power them. At one of the guitar forums I frequent I started a thread about powering a TS9 Tube Screamer with a non-proprietary nine volt power supply, One Spot came back twice in the replies. Since that time I acquired a two more pedals so now I really needed something. I looked into powered pedal boards but decent boards were too expensive and too bulky me. I got creative, I ordered a One Spot Combo Pack then bought some 2" wide industrial strength Velcro and built my own board that fits in my hard-shell brief case.So far so good, after two months of band practices the One Spot 9V DC adapter with the Multi Plug daisy chain cable does what I bought it for, my little four pedal setup works beautifully. I'm perfectly happy it. The One Spot adapter is well made and the cable is ten feet long so it should be long enough to reach your stage power source. The Combo Pack also includes protective caps for the unused plugs on the Multi Plug daisy chain.If you are thinking about buying this product, do it. If you have concerns about compatibility with your pedals, here is a compatibility chart.[...]Power to the pedals, Rock On!!!!
