I've been using Dunlop Nylons for almost as long as I've been playing guitar (twenty one years now). I find the .60's are just a bit too thin, but for more chord strumming style playing, such as playing rhythm, the .73's are perfect. They are flexible, but not flimsy. The tips will wear down after a while as with all picks. I estimate that a solid thirty to forty hours of playing is all you'll get with a pristine tip. However, they're definitely still usable after that. One other advantage these picks have is that they never break. So, i dont see how you can go wrong.
