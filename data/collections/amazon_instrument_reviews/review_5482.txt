I take this thing out of my rig every once in awhile, but it always finds its way back in.  Unlike Kaga, I put it at the end of my chain, right before a Boss Line selector, for multiple amps.  I used to put it at the beginning of my chaing, during my metal days, and it does well there too.  I'm more blues orientated now, and love it at the end.  With my fuzzes I can have them cracked and nice and lightly smooth, then at the end with the EQ, I got it jacked up!  Unlike most people I love a bass players V on my EQ.  I love that bass, but I play through 10's and 15's and those speakers handle it better than 12's, although I do have a 2x12 with V30's in it and it sounds nice.  This is a must have pedal though, no matter what you want your sound to end up like, if you have crapy stuf and just need an edge or really nice stuff and looking for that last bit of tone, you got it with this thing.
