This cable seems top-notch to me.  Some complaints I heard had to do with this brand not lasting.  (Of course, those guys abuse their equipment.)  Maybe that will be something I'll encounter, but this cable appears to be very well made--and it works great.  I take very good care of my gear, so I expect this one to last.  Only gave it four out of five because I'd rate some other cables slightly higher.  This a great cable, the length is perfect for practice, and I'd buy another.
