I will just say that in my opinion, if you are looking for something to take your Taylor to a gig in, you are better served with an SKB. In a sense, the case should mirror the guitar it will hold. However, all that being said, this gig bag is perfect for less expensive guitars. It is well crafted and cheap. I use it for my Ibanez Exotic Acoustic Electric. A nice guitar, but not one that i would cry about if it got a scratch or two. Anyway, i also store some extra picks, my strap, and a couple cords in the bag (along with a fretboard cloth, a set of strings, a tuner, and an allen wrench for the truss rod). All in all, great value for a good item.
