I just used this for a gig on Monday ... it's solid, well built, nothing loose or floppy, it stands up straight (extending to almost 7 feet tall), it folds up easily, and is nice and compact when folded ... good enough for me.One further note, when I ordered this, I was thinking that I would be able to just unscrew the vertical section from my round heavy base (which is also an "On Stage") and screw it into this tripod ... that's not the case, as the vertical piece here is integral to the tripod base.  I'm not unhappy though, this stand works quite well.
