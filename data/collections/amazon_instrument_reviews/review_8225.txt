Very accurate tuner BUT it broke within the first week I used it.  The little head on the tuner is connected with an arm and a ball and even when  you are gently the three prongs holding the ball joint can crack and break rendering it useless.  I will try to get a replacement... Now as a tuner it was really quite good but just not durable which is kinda what you need.
