Back plate has a "greenish" tint, and is single ply, not 3-ply as advertised.Color wasnt as advertised, its more of an "off-white" than a vintage cream. But I guess its close enough considering the price.Shipping took far too long. (Not sure if Music123 or USPS is to blame for that, but Id go with USPS)Besides those minor faults, the items fit well and look good.My 2006 Strat now has the look of a '57, without the huge price tag.
