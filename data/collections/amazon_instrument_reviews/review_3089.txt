I was a bit skeptical on purchasing this pedal based on some of the reviews here, however most of the problems seemed related to using it as a volume pedal as opposed to an expression pedal. I only wanted this so that I could pair it with my RE-20 to control the intensity, and in that aspect, I can confirm that it works/pairs flawlessly. My only complaint is that the pedal seems to be extremely sensitive. For example; I tested using it as an expression pedal to control the filter of a VST synthesizer, and it was recognized and mapped without issue, but rocking the pedal ever-so-slightly would cause erratic movement on the filter. This is the same behavior that I have when connected to the RE-20, in that the slightest pedal movement will make the intensity or repeat rate to jump in a fashion that's anything but gradual. It's not the end of the world, but I was hoping that the movement would have been a bit more precise.
