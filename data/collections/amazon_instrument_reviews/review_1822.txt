We have an old acoustic around the house, but I rarely play it, opting instead for the electric. This is going to be hard to believe, but the strings on the acoustic were last changed more than two decades ago.When we put these new strings on the guitar (Lotus), the sound, as you might imagine, was incredible--bright and clear.These are fairly pricey, but I am very impressed with the quality.
