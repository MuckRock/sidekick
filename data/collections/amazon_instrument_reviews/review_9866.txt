I purchased this to add basic effects to a small PA based on daisy-chainedPowerwerks PW50 Portable PA Systemheads and got a lot more than I bargained for.The effects are beautifully done. Reverb sounds natural and there is a wide range of choices for both reverb and echo. For the record I keep mine set at Club with the wet/dry knob set to a straight 12 o'clock position. Wet means more of the effect and dry means less.There is a mic gain on the left side of the unit, and the mic input (XLR only) has phantom power. The XLR out goes straight to your mixer. There is also a USB port for software I do not use so I cannot speak to that feature.The unexpected bonus on this device is the tone feature, which I leave on. It adds a dimension to vocals that does not interfere with them, not does it alter them in ways that are mechanical sounding - you can set it for minor to major pitch correction. I suspect that most folks will want less of this than more.Overall this is a perfect addition to a vocalist's toolbox because it is straightforward to use and relatively inexpensive. It's also perfect for adding vocal effects to small, bare-bones PA systems. It transformed mine from essentially a loudspeaker to a true PA.
