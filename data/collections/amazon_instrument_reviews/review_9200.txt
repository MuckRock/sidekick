These strap pins are fantastic. They securely hold the strap on your guitar very nicely. The oval shape is perfect. There is no need for proprietary or expensive "strap locks". They are easy to install. These elliptical pins are great. Terrific yet simple concept. They also look great! I highly recommend these to anyone who has a guitar. I will never use strap locks again after trying these. Great value.
