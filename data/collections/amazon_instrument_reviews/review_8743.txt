i had a dr-07 that i loved but it mysteriously walked out during a gig we played at a local bar.  i got this one because it has similar features and it costs less.  i never used the reverb or overdubbing capabilities of the dr 07 anyway and i usually used it with the mics folded in.  i have recorded several rehearsals with this one and i cant tell a difference between the recordings i made with the dr 07 and the recordings from this one.  this recorder is great for recording band rehearsals.
