In my house, I don't have to play quietly when rehearsing.... but when I really want to play along with a song and put some 'volume' to it, I can do it now without even a concern for our dogs, the neighbors, or my wife.  This device, as the product description tells you, allows you to plug it into your bass, plug your earbuds or headphones into it, set the volume and gain controls to suit, and play away in complete quiet to the rest of the world.  In addition, and this is the best part, there's a 1/8&#34; jack on this device that allows you to plug an mp3 player into it so you can play along with music of your choice.  I rehearse often with this thing.  You might think negatively about this device considering the fact that you can't control all the tone parameters like you can when rehearsing through your bass amp.  That's true.  But, the big thing is being able to use it for what it was designed for and all the ways it makes rehearsing simpler (less equipment-complicated) and quiet when necessary (lots of households have that need for quiet that don't always blend well with your rehearsal schedule, etc).  I paid $50 for it, and it works great,...worth the money for certain.
