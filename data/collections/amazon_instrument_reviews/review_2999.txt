This strap replaces another one just like it which I use with an acoustic guitar for giving lessons.  For stage I like something heavier.  Good quality.  The holes work with my strap buttons okay.  My lower button is an output jack for an after-market pickup which is wider than a normal strap button.  But this strap works okay with it.  It just takes a little more force to get it on which I'm sure will go away over time with use.  Great price for a simple strap at around $5.
