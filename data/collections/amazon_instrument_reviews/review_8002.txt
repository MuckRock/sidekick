You really need to double the quantity and charge accordingly. The single order wasn't really enough to do one guitar and I doubt you could do a bass, either. I used the copper under a clear pickguard, which matched the rest of the guitar pretty closely. Then, I finished the pickguard compartment and the jack area with aluminum foil tape from my local hardware store.
