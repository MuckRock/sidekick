I sent this to my grown daughter for her birthday and she has been very pleased with the product. I have three tuners myself and I find the Korg to be portable, easy to use and easy to read. Battery life appears to be adequate. Oh, and not to forget...accurate. Shipping was faster than advertised. A "thumbs up for this one". Amazon comes through again on price and product.
