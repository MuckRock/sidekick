If you want a strap for $5 you can't expect the moon. I bought this along with 2 other straps of higher price. This is simple. I would not want to use it with a tank top on (or for guys on skin) because it is stiff and not "comfy" but it is practical and works well. The leather ends fit securely on to my guitar snaps. Both ends are the same - leather. (one of my straps has a string on the end - this kind does not - it is made for the snaps)No bells or whistles but I would recommend it for the price.
