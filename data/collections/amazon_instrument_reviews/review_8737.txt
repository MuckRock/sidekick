Best recorder for the money I've seen...Easy to use, easy to scroll through the menu and manipulate the settings...The nearest competitor to this is slightly slimmer, witch to me would not be a plus because I don't use this on a camera rig..The picture leads you to believe this is bigger than it actually is...Check out the youtube vids on it, i believe it to be more versatile than its competition, and the build quality is higher as well...The only thing the other has on this one is its size....
