I ordered them because they are carbon fiber, but love them because I DON'T loose picks anymore! I used to lose a pick every other day. Bought six, still have six a week later. :)Here's how I keep it: about midway over the fretboard, slide it between the E, B, and G strings (the three smallest strings) and slide it up towards the headstock. It has little gecko-like protrusions that grip the E string. Stays in place and CANNOT slip out. Wonderful!
