Okay well I lied in subject line, bad singers sound bad whatever mic you put in their hand.  I can say that with authority since I run KJ shows 6 nights a week and have for the last 20+ years, so I know good singers when I hear them.  And they will ask if I have a shure SM58, to which i reply Hell No, you think I'm going to put a 58 in the hands of a careless drunk?  The more you drink the better you sound or so some of my patrons believe.  Some also drop the mic or worse, spike the mic.  I'd rather lose one of these Behringers than a 58.  Or a wireless 58.  Sound wise these are great for their intended purpose.  If you need a sturdy all metal cheap mic, this is the bargain.
