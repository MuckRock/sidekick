I live in a dry climate, and I have to add distilled water to my humidifiers almost daily.  Since I can't afford to add a special room to humidify my instruments, the planet waves humidipak is the next best thing.  I get anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks out of a pack.  The time and effort this pack saves me to keep my humidifiers repleted with water is well worth the price. On the refillable humidifiers, you really can't forget more than a day or two to replenish the water.  With the humidpak, you have a lot more security.  Going on a trip?  You won't have to worry about your string instruments if you have these in your case.
