These strings actually save you money because you don't have to change em much. I keep em on a year or so and I play alot, out door indoor. constant abuse. they never rust. When they break I change em.now..I'm not a player who likes new strings to begin with so I like not having to change em..they really hold up. There are better sounding strings yes. But if your plugin in anyway, you can tweak the tone.The tone isn't bad, just not as good as a martin uncoated string.but if you like longevity and less squeak. these are great.
