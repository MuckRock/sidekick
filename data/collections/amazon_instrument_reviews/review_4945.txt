For the money, this one's a no-brainer.  It's a one-trick pony, but that's what it's supposed to be, and it does its trick very well.  Sounds better than the Ibanez or Boss models - warmer and less processed-sounding.  Plugged into a solid-state amp, at its lowest drive setting, it sounds like you're playing clean through a tube amp.  Plugged into my '65 Twin Reverb (not a re-issue, but the real thing)- WOW!I just got it a couple of weeks ago, but it looks like it will hold up to gigging without a problem. Don't be a 'gear snob' who looks down on lesser-expensive products - the sound is what matters.
