If you have a better mic, you can plug that into the transmitter as it's a simple mini jack (1/8&#34;) and that helps this sound wise quite a bit!  I will say range is not great, it won't go 500 feet like my expensive Sennheiser kit but this will go about 30 feet line of sight before  cutting out.Note it's VHF, not UHF so it is more prone to interference.I find the transmitters' to be cheap and the battery cover does not fit all that well.  I also wish it was an XLR connection.  A lock on the plug to the transmitter would also have been nice and note the clip and all that is plastic so don't toss this around or it WILL break.For general use in doors, it's decent and for sure worth the price...but if you're looking for something clear, you should look to spend at least $500 on a wireless lapel or handheld system.
