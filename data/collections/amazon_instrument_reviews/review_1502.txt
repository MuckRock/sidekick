Been a fan of these for years now. I occasionally use other strings for fun, but these will always be my go to strings every time. They feel great on the fingers for such a long period of time, sliding is easy, and they keep their tone forever it seems like. I recommend these to everyone I talk to who plays guitar, and they always stick with em. GET EM! You wont be sorry.
