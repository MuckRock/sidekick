I originally bought several of these cables to use between our DMX light fixtures. The day they arrived I happened to need a six foot cord on my live mic stand so I tried one of these. The cable is soft and flexible and I could not tell any difference in sound from the custom cable I had been using (that's a good thing, my other cable was very expensive).The connectors are not gold plated but it's an inexpensive cable, it's not pretending to be anything other than a decent low-cost XLR two-conductor shielded cable. It's working for me, I'll be buying more for our studio.
