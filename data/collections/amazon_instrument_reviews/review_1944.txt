We live in an age of endless boutique guitar effect pedals.  One could make a very expensive hobby of collecting only high dollar dirt pedals.  It's not unusual to see an online review and think a pedal sounds good then find out that it costs $150, $200, $250, $350...whatever.  There are a LOT of really expensive distortion/OD pedals out there.I've had my Bad Monkey for about 7 years, after hearing good things I took a chance and gigged with it for many years.  I rarely use a lot of gain on most pedals, just because those fuzzier tones can easily get lost in the mix.  I generally use the Bad Monkey for mid-gain crunch tones, and for that it's just fantastic.Having two tone controls makes all the difference.  This pedal is Tubescreamer-esque, but not as midrange-heavy as a TS.  Anyway, this thing sounds great.  Excellent classic rock and lead tones.The things it WON'T do: 1) a clean boost.  It has plenty of output, but there's always a little bit of dirt in the signal, so it can't be used as a pure clean boost.  2)  it won't clean up when you turn your guitar down...or at least not much.  No dialing in a crunch tone then turning down your guitar volume for a clean rhythm tone.  I have a Barber LTD which does that beautifully.But, despite those limitations, the Bad Monkey is awesome.  At the very least it can be a great "throw in your case to take to a jam" pedal, but it's worth having on your pedalboard, as well.
