I haven't picked up a guitar in 15 years, but this was a LONG Winter and I needed something to occupy my time.I broke out my Strat and discovered that the amp was dead - mice had eaten the wiring.Crap.So - Online to see what defined "State of the Art".  This is It.If you need a basic practice amp that, with a decent laptop and internet connection, can help you produce ANY sound with a few simple instructions THIS IS IT.No Foot pedals or expensive add-ons [until you really have to have them]... Just pure creative sound that won't break the bank.Buy This Amp !
