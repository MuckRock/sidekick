I read the reviews with low stars, the major complaints are squeaking sound when you twist the head. We use it to hold the musics and don't need to turn the head. The heads of music stands on stage are fixed too, if they turned, they could not fit into the music stand rack. This one work great for us.We have several music stands,  we didn't like them not because the heads can't be turned but they are unstable and can't hold thick book.
