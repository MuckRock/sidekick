This stand is practically indestructible and is ideal for gigging. If you need a boom, simply add anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom, Blackand you're good to go.In addition to being indestructible, this stand takes up far less stage (or studio) real estate than a tripod type stand like theOn Stage Stands MS7701 Tripod Boom Microphone Stand. And despite the relatively small size of the base, it is far more stable than the tripod stands. Admittedly, this stand is a great deal heavier, so if weight is an issue you may not like this type.Even with a boom fully extended I have found this stand to be stable. For outside use in fair breezes this stand remains upright, which is not always the case with the tripod types. Moreover, there are no legs to break (I have lost one tripod stand to that problem.)If you transport your gear often, and especially if you play outside (or inside on cramped stages) this stand is the best choice in my opinion.
