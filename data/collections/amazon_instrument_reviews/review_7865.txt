I have a Martin HD-28 with the large Grover tuners.  This string winder fits the tuning knobs perfectly.If you change your strings regularly, this does make it significantly easier without risking damage to tuners.For $6, these are pretty high quality and this should be the only string winder you need to buy for a long time.
