I needed a Jack Plate for my custom Stratocaster build and ordered this one.  It was far better than I expected.  It is very heavy duty, great chrome plating.  Not at all what I expected for the money.  A definite quality part worthy of this project that will be with me for life.  Nothing but the best going on this guitar, including this plate.
