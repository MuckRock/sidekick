I use to have a guitar that sounded horrible with this thing in there. It was a pain to take out, too. However, it got a new lease on life with my new guild guitar. It did stop feedback issues and sounded somewhat better overall. I had to cut part of it for the volume and tone control which is located in the sound hole. Something you might want to think about before getting one of these.
