This new type and design of capos, manufactued in England (and warranteed for life) is truly wonderful.  Available in six and twelve string steel-string as well as a new classical version, they are all easy to use, solidly built and - perhaps most importantly, easy to put on and take off with one hand without having to retune!  For a musician, this is the most cricial element - that, and that it is 'kind' to the materials used in the manufacture of a good guitar.  I use mine on a Martin HD28 and have had no problems whatsoever. A great move toward a new generation of capos! Not cheap - but worth every cent.
