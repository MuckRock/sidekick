This is unique piece that slips into just about any tube on a Mixer Rack or Piano scissor stand. The square nut design is very tight when tightening in the tube as if there are a rough cut on the threading. The MIC end of the mount works pretty good. Overall the only problems I found is that the Up tube could be 1' to 1 1/2' taller and the threads could be buffed out at the manufacturer.
