I am 65 years old and have been taking violin lessons for about nine months.  As you can imagine, I need to practice a LOT!  My wife of 43 years does not enjoy my practicing...especially when I practice monotonous scales.I saw the Glaesel Violin Ultra Practice Mute demonstrated on an online violin instructor's web site.  I love it!  Easy to put on and take off. The rubber won't hurt your violin, bridge or strings. You can barely hear it in the next room.  You can actually control how much the mute actually mutes your violin by raising it a little bit above the bridge.  My violin's tone doesn't change much at all with this mute.Now I can practice all I want without fear of my wife divorcing me!
