This shelf is exactly what I needed, at a reasonable price. I used this on my wall-mount 4U rack to hold my modem and router near my switch. As an added bonus, it has vent holes on the bottom, which not only allow for heat dissipation, but also make really convenient ziptie tie-down locations. I'll definitely be buying more of these.
