I'm not going to recommend this over the $15 capos. It's better if you spend the extra cash and get one that is well made. I decided to try this one out, but the construction of it makes it feel like it's going to break if I pull it too hard. And, because of that, it makes it difficult to put on the guitar neck and also to remove. But, once it's on, it works.
