I bought this amp for my 7 year old son. It is great for him, but not really for a serious practice amp.Pros:SmallClean and dirty channelHead phone jackCons:Speaker is low quality and sounds rough when distorted or loud.Suggestion:Step up $30-$40 and get a better setupGood alternatives: Fender Mustang, Peavey Viper, Line6 Spider IV, Vox, or Marshall.
