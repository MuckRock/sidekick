.I BOUGHT A UKULELE  TO GIVE AS A PRESENT.  I KNEW THE STRINGS THAT COME EQUIPPED  ON NEW MUSICAL STRINGED INSTRUMENTS WOULD BE OF POOR QUALITY SO I PURCHASED THESE MARTIN STRINGS AS A REPLACEMENT.  I'VE USED MARTIN INSTRUMENTS FOR MANY YEARS, AM FOND OF THE MAKE AND QUALITY OF THE MARTIN PRODUCTS.  THIS WAS AN EASY CHOICE FOR ME. THERE ARE OTHER EXCELLENT STRINGS AVAILABLE.  THIS JUST WAS MY CHOICE THIS TIME.
