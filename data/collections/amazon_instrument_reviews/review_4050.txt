There's not a whole lot one can say about a guitar strap, but I'll try. This one is sturdy and adjusts more easily than some I've tried. It's fairy thick and the material doesn't slip around on your shoulder easily. Aesthetically, the woven print is abslutely beautiful. The photo cannot do it justice. The colors and rich and vibrant and the weave is tight, not chintzy or frayed. I'm very pleased with the product and the price.
