I have a love/hate relationship with compressors. For $40.00, you can't go wrong with this one. I use it a lot on my practice rig. If you need a top notch compressor, hands down the Keeley 4 knob. I use a Keeley in my live shows. Expensive but worth it. As for this Joyo, I can't complain. It does it's job pretty good but it does color your tone some what. True bypass is nice, it's noticeable in your chain, but not to much to take it out. I love for my practice rig. Good buy if you're on a budget (all us musicians are) just don't expect to blown away by it. For $40- give it a shot, I did and don't regret it :)
