It does everything it's supposed to do. I got these for about $12 here on Amazon. The Dunlop or Schaller versions of strap locks are usually twice that with no perceivable benefit that I can see.They lock securely, don't require any alterations to your strap or guitar to use them and they have different finishes to match your guitar's hardware.I have both Dunlop and Hennessy straplocks and I don't see any reason to pay more for the Dunlops.
