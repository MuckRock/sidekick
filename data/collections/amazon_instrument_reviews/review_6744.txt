My Big muff PI with Wicker had hellacious noise, I mean unusable. I noticed it would change with movement so I pulled the back off and immediately found paint overspray where the grounding spring from the circuit board meets the inside of the housing. After aggressively scraping the paint off, the pedal operates as I would expect it to.I really like the tone and aggressive drive of the big muff and the Tone and wicker switches are nice although I find that with the Wicker opened up/ON the noise level gets marginally too high; so long as you're playing hard and loud it's not really an issue. This pedal isn't designed to be quiet when you're not playing so don't be fooled there, it is normal for it to make some noise when there's not guitar input/strumming. The bypass on the other hand seems to be clean as advertised.I'll be keeping the pedal and like it but the lack of QA from my proudly made in America fuzz pedal was a bit of a let down; fortunately I found the problem and fixed it myself to avoid a return.
