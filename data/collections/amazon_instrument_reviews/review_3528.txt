First time for a  soft wedgie......pick that is (I did have an older brother : ) ). I used it on my new ukulele and sounds and feels great. Very good price and looks like they will last awhile.I highly recommend they for you to try, if you don't like they you can give a fellow musian a &#34;soft wedgie&#34; which they just may like.
