Mixed my band's album with these headphones - the sound quality is impressive in all ranges, and they have a very respectable bass response. They're also great for drum practice, as they block out the loudness of the drums so I can hear my metronome perfectly. They're also awesome for live recording use as a monitor. I will definitely be purchasing several more of these in the future.
