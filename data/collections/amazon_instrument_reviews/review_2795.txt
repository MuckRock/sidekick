I read a lot of positive reviews on the 9.5s and after some use, I am kind of disappointed.CONSTRUCTION:They are just like any other strings, just lighter gaugePACKAGING:It arrived well packaged and was in perfect conditionPRICE:At $4.99 new with free 2 day shipping, this is a no brainer.CONCLUSION:I initially liked the feel of these strings, but the more I played the more I realized that it didnt have the tone I was looking for. I am used to 10s and 11s and though they are more difficult to bend with, they sound much fuller. I put these on my latest stratocaster build and have since replaced them with 10s.
