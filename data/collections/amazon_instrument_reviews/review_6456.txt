I bought this to go with my Super Champ X2 combo.  It works.  It also came with a cord.I was not happy the Super Champ X2 didn't come with it.  Both my Hot Rod Deluxe and Blues DeVille came with foot switches.  And you really need the foot switch to use the X2's various voicings and effects. Now the X2 is my main amp.
