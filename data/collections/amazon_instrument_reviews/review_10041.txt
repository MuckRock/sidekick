As with any new device or toy we buy we discover the good and bad points...first the good....THE GOOD: 8 tracks that can be recorded 2 at a time...has RCA outs which is good for monitors and or headphone amp as well as a 1/8" headphone out...a durable feel, a nice design, XLR inputs with phantom power, lit screen to see better (Very Nice)... wav 16bit 44khz recordings, auto punch in, comes with a 2gb card and can take up to 32GB SD cards...has effects has a metronome, mastering internal track apart form the 8 tracks, built in guitar tuner, EQ, Compression in and out, nice dual stereo up front mics that are real good sounding and all 8 track mixing, bouncing to 2 of your tracks  even the tracks that are bounced to, the previous tracks 'that are there' that still are plying bounce too, very cool...and much more....THE BAD: short battery life, No AC adapter included, need to buy (Cheap off ebay around $8.00)...small buttons, bad sounding reverbs, auto punch in gives you 2 seconds after pushing buttons to record, COME ON TASCAM, 2 SECONDS!!!!!?????? I can't get back into recording part with a guitar in 2 lead in seconds all alone!!!!! No guitar effects or Drum patterns like Boss's BR Micro 4 and 80...(boss has it's problems too, believe me)sometimes it just hangs up, (think there is an unlock or reset pen press thing on the side)HORRIBLE REVERBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!moreEven though this untit has its good and not so goods, it is a great device, you can import and export songs to this to and from your computers recording software, remember its 16 bit wavs only to and from DAW.....Tascam please lengthin the auto punch lead in from 2 seconds to 5 seconds or more on next firmware and dont make another new unit just to improve what a firmware can do!!!....Jim
