For those that want to record(I use Adobe Audition) this item is good for recording.I use to use my sound card. This provides a smoother sound and I don't have to worry about hissing when I record.You can just plug in your guitar or bass.Here is a letter I wrote to Tascam:On humble advice I would forward this email to all of your subsidiaries any retail store that sells Tascam USB audio devices! Anywhere in the world.Just today I got the new Tascam US-100 USB audio interface. It of course uses the Windows audio drivers. A nightmare occured. When I plugged in the device Windows XP had the usual "detect USB device" come up. But to my horror it wound up saying "A hardware problem occured your hardware may not operate properly" something of that sort.I spent over 4 hours trying to figure this whole thing out and I read the manual it came with. Tried all sorts of things oh brother! It still would not install. By the way this happened with a previous USB audio device, not made by Tascam, that did the excact same thing on my computer.But to my luck I found out what the problem was! Thank God for the website that had this on a blog!:In the c:\windows\inf folder there must exist two files:wdma_usb.infwdma_usb.PNFIt is really the .inf file that is important. Some software  seems to knock these out by renaming them to:wdma_usbinf.bakwdma_usbpnf.bakI simply found the files, opened them and renamed them to the proper names. And lo and behold when I restarted my computer the Tascan US 100 worked!Its easy to rename the files you just open wdma_usbinf.bakwdma_usbpnf.bak and  then save them as wdma_usb.infwdma_usb.PNF.Its that simple!!Anyone who works customer service for Tascam should know this. Like I said it happend with a previous USB audio device that I had and I woulnd up selling it at eBay cause I was so frustrated.I'm happy with the Tascam US 100.I hope this helps if your audio does not work on your computer. And it did the same with a USB phone.
