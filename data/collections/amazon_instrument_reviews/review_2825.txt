I brought this set beasue one of the strings broke on the kid size guitar, and I also wanted to have backup strings.  I haven't tried many different strings.  I have used the strings (D'addario EXP) that came with on my Takamine GS330S, and it's been good for year+. IIf the strings break, I will try this one GS330S as well.  Over all, I think D'addario is great for warm balance tones. After the strings were set and "stretch" for few days playing, it stays in tune.  The strings were set for more than 6 months, they still are playable, and the sounds are okay on kid size guitar.  I don't think there will be any problem if the strings are on my GS330S.  I'm happy with the purchase and the quality of the strings.
