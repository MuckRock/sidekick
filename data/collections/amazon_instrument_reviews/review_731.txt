I was looking for a sound hole pickup and this came as one of the best and found it to be all I expected. I use it for practice and recording myself. I really like it but for the price I wish it had just a bit more otherwise its perfect. I have it on my 1994 Martin D-18  which has a big bottom end and no matter what it always sounds fine. I have had the pickup installed for four months and it is good.
