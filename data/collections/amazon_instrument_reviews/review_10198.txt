Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is as near perfect a capo that I've ever come across. I've been a Kyser Capo gal for many, many years but, this capo has that one beat by a mile. There was absolutely new fret buzz no matter which of my guitars I tried it on or which fret I placed it on. As I strummed each string to sound was so clear. It's also very easy to open with one hand and keep it open, without any stress to your hand, until you release your grip to clamp it into place.I do believe the folks at Planet Waves have developed the best capo ever! And the price ain't so bad either.
