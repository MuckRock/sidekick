I was expecting to be taken to heaven with these headphones.They are not all that impressive compared to the beats on ear headphones.But the would do just perfect for recording vocals but when it comes listening to music I say go for Dr.Dre Beats.If you want to know what the noise isolation feels like , just putting your hands on your ear.
