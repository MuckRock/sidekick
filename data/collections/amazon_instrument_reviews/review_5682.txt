I bought these to replace a pair of ATH-M45s I had for 6 years. I used my old headphones for listening to music and for tracking in my recording studio. These have assumed the same role and perform wonderfully. I play a lot of electric drums and these cans do a great job of isolating the outside world from what I hear inside the headphones. Listening to music on them is a joy. Everyone has an opinion about a &#34;burn in&#34; period, mine seemed to open up at about 50-60 hours. I listen to music about 3 - 4 hours a day.
