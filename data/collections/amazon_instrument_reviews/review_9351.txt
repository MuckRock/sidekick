I've been using Ableton for 4 years and it never crashes. I connected this interface with LIve 9 on windows 8.1 i set my default playback and recording device as &#34;Line Out Scarlett 2i2 USB &#34; and set it as my default device. It crashes every time  in Ableton but works well with listening to music either on my computer or on YouTube. Sometimes i hears pops and clicks after 5 minutes and have to reset the ASIO4ALL driver which is the same issue with my Audio Technica at2020 USB MIc.My computer is an AMD system and i have used my at2020(USB) on a Dell intel laptop but i never heard any pops and clicks even after using for hours so i am not sure whether this has to do with different hardware used in different computers or whatsoever but. i think it would be better to use this interface on and intel based system because through my experience.
