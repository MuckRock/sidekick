Very nice classical guitar strap. I have used this style of strap for over forty years with traditional style classicals that do not have strap buttons.  Don't expect it to work like a strap on a standard acoustic or electric guitar. This is designed to only hold the guitar in position while you are playing it. It will not hold the guitar if your hands are not on it. This is the way this type of strap is made to work, and is certainly not a design flaw as some reviewers have suggested. Holds my Cordoba in position perfectly.
