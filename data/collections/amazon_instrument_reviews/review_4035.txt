Pro Tec manufactures a variety of accessories for musical instruments.  Their low cost black nylon guitar strap, is a well constructed high quality item, that is a top seller at Amazon.  The large sized attachment tabs are quite thick, about 1/8 inch.  Although the fit on the typical guitar strap nuts is snug, some type of strap retainer would still be recommended.  Black works with most colors, and this strap should last for a long time, but it is so inexpensive, if you qualify for free shipping, you might want to consider ordering a spare.
