This is a great guitar once you change the strings, as suggested. Great portability for the price.HOWEVER - having read reviews across multiple sites, I too am a victim of the HORRIBLE glue smell that so many others have complained about. I really liked the guitar, so I purhcased it from two separate retailers, but had to return both due to the horrific smell. I even tried contacting the manufacturer to send a "smell-free" case... And they sent a case. But it stunk too. It's a shame, I had to return them, because they were nice little guitars.
