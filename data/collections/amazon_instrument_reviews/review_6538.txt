This "would" be a great digital reverb but for the fact that the more you turn the level up on the reverb intensity, it simultaneously fades the initial attach of the strum, pluck or riff rendering the reverb relatively worthless if you 'want a lot of reverb". What the hell was Behringer thinking???
