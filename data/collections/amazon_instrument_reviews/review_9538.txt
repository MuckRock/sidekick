My wife was worried about what to get me for Christmas, I really didn't want anything (other than the Harley I have been asking for for 25 years, maybe next???) and while surfing Amazon I came across this Les Paul. I had to laugh since it looks so much like my Gibson Les Paul, kind of like a "Mini Me" version.Well I have never heard of a Les Paul Uke and did not think for $99 that it would be much...but the reviews were telling a different story. So I found my Christmas present at last for "the man who has everything" (it is true, my wife told me...still hoping for that Harley though). I ordered it a few days before Christmas so it would not be under the tree much to my wife's dismay...but I printed a photo of it and framed it then wrapped it up and placed it under the tree anyway. Well Christmas came which means it was also one day closer to getting the real thing (the Uke, not the Harley), but everyone had a laugh at my shocked expression and obvious glee when I opened up my framed photo of my soon to be baby Les Paul!I figured since I was taking my fellow Amazonian's word I better order some Aquila Ukulele Strings since everyone stated that the ones that came with the Uke are junk(and they are, shame of Epiphone) which I did, the Uke arrived about 4 days before the strings but I attempted to learn how to play it anyway.....OUCH those stock strings were rough on the fingers, and the sound left much to be desired so I waited until the new string were installed prior to this review.Wow with the new strings it is totally like a different instrument, it now sounds as good as it looks and sooooo much easier on the ole fingers. I just love it now!!!!So if you decide to get one of these Mini Me Les Paul's do yourself a favor and get.......A set if Aqila stringsAquila USA Aquila Concert Ukulele StringsA Snark Uke Tuner SN-6Snark SN-6 Ukulele TunerA nice leather guitar strapFender Plain Leather Guitar Strap With Fender Logo, BlackandA Daily Ukulele Song Book by Jumpin JimThe Daily Ukulele: 365 Songs for Better Living  [DAILY UKULELE] [Paperback]You will love all of these items I am sure.When it arrives be sure to practice "Billie Jean" played by Jim Hill...see it on YouTube...it is a riot![...]orJake Shimabukuro Bohemian Rhapsody[...]Enjoy!
