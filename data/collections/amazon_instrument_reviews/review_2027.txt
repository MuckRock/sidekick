I knew I did right by buying the DR-212. It's great and stands up to much more expensive of it's kind.I have lots of Gibsons as well as Epiphones and frankly I don't see any difference to speak of. If anybody wants a durable acoustic 12 string with fine sound you'll find it in the DR-212.Best of Luck to allRegards,Roger  Epiphone DR-212 Acoustic Guitar, 12-String, Natural
