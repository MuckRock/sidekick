I just recieved these in the mail today, and these seem to be much better quality than the original pegs in my guitar! Not much else to describe, they're fairly simple to use, and they're selling you 12 of them, so I have a spare set now! My original pegs were also white, on an all black guitar, so I'm totally excited for the new look these pegs give my guitar. I definitely recommend these for anyone that needs/wants black pegs for their acoustic, or acoustic/electric gutiar.
