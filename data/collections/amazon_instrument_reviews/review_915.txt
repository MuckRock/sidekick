They work good.  Way to stiff and small for me though.  Great attack but holding onto it is the problem.  The slick finish makes it kinda hard to hold onto and the small amount of pick that shows makes strumming difficult without hitting your finger on the strings.  I imagine it would work great for lead players but I'm a rhythm player.
