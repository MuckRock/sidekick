I wanted a portable headphone amp but bought this instead because it was only a few bucks more and offers a ton more features.  Though it's not perfect, it's like having a room full of guitar effects and different amps.PROS:  32 amp models, 16 cabinet models, effects + thousands of available presets = TONES GALORE; good software for managing tones and creating new ones; can be used in front of an amp (in case you want to know how a modeled Mesa/Boogie would sound coming out of a real Vox); lots of connectivity; compact enough that I keep the unit, the cable and the power supply in my case; no tech problems at all; built-in noise gate and tuner; easy-to-use tap feature.CONS:  There's a learning curve and you will need the manual to know stuff like how to change amp models; manual is a pdf file; hard to keep track of preset tones on the unit (though you can rename and re-arrange them with the software); presets based on famous songs don't always sound right; minor background hum; uses 4 AAA's in a few hours and the manual says don't use rechargables (though it doesn't say why); for legal reasons, the unit uses generic amp names (check the manual to match the amp model names to the amps they're based on); with everything plugged in the whole setup becomes a little unwieldy; doesn't sound as nice as a good pedal and a Marshall half stack (no kidding, right?  And I still don't sound like Alvin Lee).As an inexpensive effects box that also works as a portable headphone amp, this thing is cool.  You won't get bored with it but you will need to learn how to use it.  Master some of the amp/cab models and how to tweak them for gain, reverb, delay, etc. before you dive into the presets.  And once you've got the presets you like best, use the software to put them all in one place so you can find them easily.The Line 6 Pocket Pod Pack includes a patch cord, power supply, USB cable, CD, cheap ear buds, and MP3 player cable.  The Pack is 150 new, so if you're going to buy the power supply then just get the Pack.  If you buy used then the manual describes how to do a factory reset so it's like new again.
