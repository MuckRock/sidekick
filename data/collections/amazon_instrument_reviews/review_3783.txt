This is the last Capo you will ever need to buy unless you have the need for both curved and straight capos for various fretboards in which case you'll still want to stay with the G7th capos for both needs. No need to worry about damaging your guitar neck from over tightening or nonpadded contact. No spring clamp to wear out & lose gripping strength which produces a buzz over time.  Low profile design is the easiest for playability as you don't have to learn to play around it like you do on a Keyser. The unique, adjustable tension also allows you to control to sound to your liking, great for advanced tricks like capoing just a few strings. Can't say enough about this easy to use tool with ultra simple, unobtrusive design.  Love it and have one in every case.
