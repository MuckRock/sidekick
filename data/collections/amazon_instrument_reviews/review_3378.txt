This holder is spring loaded so it makes inserting and removing picks easy. It has a little sticky tab on the back so you can stick it to something (such at the side of back of your instrument) so you always know where your picks are and always have them on hand. I don't know exactly how many it holds, and the thickness of the picks makes a difference, but I've crammed quite a few of varying sizes in here without issues.
