I recently picked up a used Casio Privia PX-320 and it had a cheesy, little square sustain pedal that slipped around and had a terrible feel. I heard that Casios were finicky about third party pedals, but purchased this anyway.  It worked (I needed to set the polarity switch on this pedal to open).It also worked perfectly on my Roland RD-300NX, but I expected that. What I love about this pedal is it has a fantastic feel that rivals a real piano, and is the equal to the feel of my expensiveRoland RPU-3.One main reason why I gave this five stars in addition to the compatibility is it's built to last. It's heavy, all metal exterior except for the bottom pad, and has a six foot cable that allows you to place it practically anywhere. Plus the price is right. In fact, the entire package is impressive when I compared it to other models that I considered. And it's light years ahead of the OEM pedals that Casio ships with their Privia keyboards.
