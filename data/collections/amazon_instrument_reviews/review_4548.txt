this stand is VERY GOOD ! nice and strong , i recommend if you can only afford a low price one to get this , it is worth a lot more then 29 dollars, this will last a life time, and its not real heavy you can pick it up and move it easily,,i was looking at the cheep fold up ones and read some of the reviews and then remembered seeing them in different yards out by the trash cans to be picked up with the trash,, so i looked for something better and ,i am so happy to have found this , at this price.i didn't want to pay more then 15 dollars for a stand ,but i really wanted something to last and if i bought one for 9 or 15 dollars and in 6 months its in the trash ,i would be buying another one , so really ,this is the BEST DEAL , i am SO HAPPY I BOUGHT THIS STAND you can't go wrong with this one,,,REALY !! get it !  it will hold a few books and stand should not tip over,its heavy enough not to, it slides up and down nicely, and the book shelf  tilts easly and stays and you can turn it as well, .,bolts are NOT plastic,witch is nice,,and very easy to put together and fast,,i got it together in one minute,i only used regular pliers to put it together..  the stand goes low enough for sitting or high enough for standing up while playing instrument,i truly recommend this for anyone  ! (i did get the foot guards for $1.95 to protect floor, on carpet you will not need them ,)and it comes with a 10 year warranty ,and with the free shipping you can't beet it,
