Admittedly, I don't use these on my high end stuff, I use these on my cheap axes to bang on.  Why?  The are strong, durable, and sound good.  The tone isn't as pure as some other strings on the market but for the cost, they do the job.  The really good strings I typically have to change often, as I like a light string.These hold up well, taking a good bend and beating.If you have a teenager who isn't light with the pick, or if you have something you tend to get very aggressive with, these are perfect..5 stars for what they are.
