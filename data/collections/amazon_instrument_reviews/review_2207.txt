I'll keep this short and simple, I do alot of radio work, and saw the price of this mic of eBay (I wanted to use Paypal) and got it. 60 bucks for something I'd have easily have paid 100+ for, and with the included shockmount, it's a total steal. This obviously won't match top quality condensers, but for speech atleast, I find it to have a wonderful crisp tone with a warm sound to compliment your voice. It just has that smooth radio sound you hear on stations like NPR, which I just love. It sounds fantastic and with a proper interface, possibly the best condenser I've tested that's under 150 bucks.
