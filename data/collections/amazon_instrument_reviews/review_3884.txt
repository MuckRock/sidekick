This is definitely a microphone stand for amateur use - it would probably fall apart fairly quick "on the road" or if it were adjusted constantly.That being said, it's a great little stand for low duty/home use. I'm using it with a Blue enCORE 100 microphone, which isn't really heavy, but still weighs close to a pound. This stand holds it very sturdily, and with the boom feature, it can be set up in just about any position I would ever need.If you have a fairly lightweight mike and just need something to set and forget, this is a decent stand.And for less than $25 bucks, it's a bargain.
