I read mixed reviews of this pedal board, but I had tried half a dozen multi effects pedals and modeling processors and pedals with limitless combinations all in one. However, I found all of those too difficult to adjust to my needs, or too cumbersome to flip through all the channels to get to the sound I wanted and then modify it. What I wanted was four or five single effects pedals that I could preset to the value I usually use and then turn on each effect as needed, giving me lots of combinations. I had a couple of Boss pedals and one Behringer one and I ordered a couple more of the inexpensive Behringer units, which I'm generally pleased with, though they're perhaps not in the elite category. They work fine for me. I didn't want 5 or 6 units cluttering up the space and each demanding its own wall wart.This compact board with its built in case and cord management was the perfect solution for me. Instead of the Velcro found on many boards, this has foam cutouts which hold the B and B pedals securely and give enough room for the connectors and daisy chain power supply to stay tangle free. It all plugs in with one adapter (provided) and it also comes with all the short connectors to connect each pedal together.My pedals are  incredibly easy to use and extremely well organized now. The case holds them securely and the lid fits on and holds everything in place for transport. Everything is ready to play by just removing the lid and plugging into the outlet.The latches are not the most secure, just a simple plastic slide that looks like it could easily break. However, there are matching holes right next to them so a small lock or even a twist tie could be inserted if the latch does malfunction.Overall, I'm extremely satisfied. If you're doing something similar to me, I'm sure you will be too. The foam cutouts can be manipulated for other sizes of pedals. I have exactly enough to fill it, with the addition of a dedicated tuner that mutes everything while I tune.
