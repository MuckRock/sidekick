It does take a little getting used to the programming aspect, but this little pedal is amazing.  I must have 20 different pedals, and I'm always torn which ones ones to bring to practice. With this pedal, it's easy...just grab and go.  Are all the sounds perfect or as good as individual analog pedals?  Probably not.  But they do the job just fine.  The thing I love the most, and this may be a little anal, but I've actually preset individual settings for each song I play with my band.  That way I can shuffle through the presets with one stomp. Some have two pedal effects, some have 6! If this broke or wore out for whatever reason, I would go right out and buy another one for sure.  Best $100 I've spent on gear.
