I ordered this pedal based on the previous review, but to me it sounds cheap and faint. I do a have a few Behringer pedals and many are very good for the price, but this one I won't be keeping. To me, it wasn't even close to as good as what you get on Fender amps or on my TC Electronics Delay pedal (which includes chorus/vibrato), and I thought that I would go solo with this pedal, but for me it's a no go...
