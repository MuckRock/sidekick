Title says it all. Good quality for home or studio use, but not sure how it would survive if it were to be taken on tour. Still for the price you get a nice adjustable stand that can be manipulated to get basically any mic position you'd want, from overhead for drums to fret level for guitars, above or below vocalists depending on the tone you're hunting, etc. Versatile and great to work with.
