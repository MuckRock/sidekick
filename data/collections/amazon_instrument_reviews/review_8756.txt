The odor of adhesive lingered for some time, but that's not really a problem.Size and fit were good. The storage compartment is nice and large.One hinge broke after about a year of normal use. It was in the house almost the whole time, I just open the case to play the guitar and then replace it when done. I noticed if you look carefully, one of the hinges is cracked on both sides, so it is not holding anything anymore, but it is one of three, so the other two still do the job just fine. It is only if you look carefully you see one hinge fractured.This was not an expensive guitar, and I had a better case, so I switched to the better guitar case, and used this one for another guitar that I really don't play at all, and it just stays in storage.
