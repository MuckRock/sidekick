I was given a violin (fiddle) by my friend who decided they would never really learn to play.  The violin hadn't been used in quite some time so the pegs were really loose and wouldn't tune at all.  I got this product to see if I could fix the problem.  It worked just as it said it would.  A drop or two on each peg tightened them up enough to be able to tune the violin.Now that it's being played more regularly it's easier to tune, but know that if they pegs get loose again I have the product to fix the problem.
