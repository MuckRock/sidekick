great leather strap  nice color well made strong and feels comfortable smooth, it wont dig in Ur shoulder like some other straps out there,,, and u can adjust it ,, i adjust mines and cut the unnecessary material,, can am lee and tall so i have no gut to have to need extra strap and i don't like to play low like to my knees, that looks trashy and cant shred cuz of the angle of ur wrist , so i use my strap waist height and looks cool proportional and  it gives me A great angle for my wrist , to be able to play fast and move up n down on the neck,,, so i say great buy,, i give it 5 stars.
