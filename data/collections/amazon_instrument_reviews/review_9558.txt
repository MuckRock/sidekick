These were just what I needed.  Over the years, some of the bridge pins on my 12-Sttring Acoustic Guitar have broken and had to be replaced.  Some of them had the white dot, some didn't, therefore, they didn't look uniform.  With these pins, the guitar now looks like it did when I bought it.  Thank You. James Edward(BAT)Owens
