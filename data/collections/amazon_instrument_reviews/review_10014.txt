I've owned Loop Stations, DM-4s, Jam Mans, Samplers and all that jazz. They're all full of crap you dont need. This pedal has flawless, colorless sound quality. It records what you sound like. You click it on, record your riff, click it and listen to it loop. Tap twice to stop or tap twice and hold to start over. You can record up to five minutes with unlimited layers. Smallest, Cheapest, easiest to use and most straight forward loop pedal you will find. If you need all the drum loops and the ability to save loops for later use, then dont get this one, but if you just want a good way to jam with yourself or a live loop similar to the DM-4 but with more time on the loop then yes get this.
