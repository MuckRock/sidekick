I have recently been itching to buy a classical guitar, as that's what I learned on as a child. I can't afford it at the moment, so I decided to give these a shot.These do not turn your steel string into a classical guitar by any stretch of the imagination. I didn't expect them to - but a guy can dream, can't he?Anyway, what they did provide was very warm and clear sound to my normally overly-bright Takamine. It also helped with the rather high action. They play and sound softer. It's almost like having a new guitar.During the stringing/stretching process I broke the G string (go easy, they are silk after all) and so had to use a standard bronze replacement. I asked my non-music oriented girlfriend if she could pick out the 'oddball' string and she got it right on the first try.. that's how much of a difference these strings make. They sound less 'metallic' - that may sound obvious but my point is that it's a big difference, enough for her untrained ears to hear.I'm still saving up for a classical, but I really love these strings, and will be using them on my Tak going forward.
