This is the best USB Condenser mic I've ever used.  I needed to buy a condenser mic recently that had to be XLR.  I bought the AT2020 XLR version, simply due to the fantastic results I've achieved with this one.I only use this microphone for podcasting.  I do not record music with it, but I haven't tried yet.  If you're curious as to the sound quality, listen to my podcast "Rock Crushes Paper" on iTunes and Zune Marketplace.Just to give you an idea of what I'm using:Windows 74 GB ramPentium 4 Dual core 2.2 ghzAdobe Auditon 3The build quality is fantastic, built like a tank really.  The only knock I have on this is the little tripod stand.  Yes, it's a tripod stand, but I can't imagine actually being in a spot where I'd rather use that then the On-Stage desktop mic stand.Anyways, great mic.  Can't recommend it enough.  It's made me check out other Audio-Technica products.
