These just don't have the right feel and the sound isn't that great compared to other materials.The quality control is so so. The picks aren't cleanly cut out they are injection molded and as a result they are left with a thin trim all around them.I'll stick with Dunlop Gator Grip .96mm or PRS 1.0 picks. For more flexibility or acoustic, I prefer Fender Medium Celluloid picks.
