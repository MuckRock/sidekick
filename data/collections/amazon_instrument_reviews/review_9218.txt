It works very well, installs easily, stays in place once installed but can be removed easily.  Does not scratch guitar's finish (just be careful, and no issues).  It will not produce the sound of a unit that is built into a guitar, but it comes very close.  A great and inexpensive way to make an acoustic also be electric.
