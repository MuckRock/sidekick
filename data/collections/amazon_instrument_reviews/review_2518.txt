I purchased 2 of these items to use with my band for the guitarists. I was disapointed when I mounted a Shure sm 58 mic on it and found that the goose neck would not stay erect. These are made far too loose and flexible for most professional mics. They may work on very small and light weight units but for my needs they are totally unuseable. It would have been helpful to include the suggested weight that this goose neck would support in the sales description. I wasted my money. Don't waste yours. Perhaps viagra would be helpful ;-)
