Frankly, I'd never heard of a "pop filter" until my popping p's and b's came into consciousness at the same time that this device popped into my field of view on an Amazon web page.  I'll bet that a couple of layers of women's nylon stockings would be just as effective, but this contraption pretty much purges your elocution of the offensive phonemes (they're called "plosives").  I'm still hearing the "s" phonemes (sibilants) along with some guttural artifacts ("back" vowels prefaced by an "h" that ignite a momentary gargling effect), but this filter doesn't purport to be able to do anything about those buggers.As for the price, after seeing the gooseneck, the base, the generous-sized screws, etc., I'm prepared to say that  this one is fairly valued (I doubt that the Shure or Blue pop filters, at almost double the price, offer anything more than brand-name status).  The hardware and build-quality are about as solid and heavy-duty as you could wish for.  (I know I'll never be able to blow it away.)  Unfortunately, the clamp seems designed to fit on a mic stand rather than a computer screen, which is almost a half-inch too thick.
