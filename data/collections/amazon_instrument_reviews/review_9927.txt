After reading many review on my Yamaha 700 acoustic guitar I have owned and played for 4 months, I finally took the advice of other consumers.  MANY people suggested changing the stock plastic nut and bridge saddle to improve tone.This guitar is an incredible deal and piece the way it was.  I did put a light set of D'addario strings that made a world of difference.I was due for another string change so upgraded with this set of bone nut and saddle.WOW, it really did make a huge difference.  This guitar is such a quality piece, especially for the money.  But, with the string and bone upgrades I can't imagine a sweeter sounding acoustic.  It changed the tone to that of a classical  guitar.  I am so happy with my changes.The high notes are pure and ring nicely and lows are rich and deep.  The sustain is a drastic improvement, each note lasting nicely into the next.  I am so pleased and excited with my guitar.If you own this or any other acoustic with plastic nut and saddle.....change them, it's a very quick fix.  And find a nice set of strings.
