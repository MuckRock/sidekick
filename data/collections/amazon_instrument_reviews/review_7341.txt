I really dig these.  I have been playing lead with them for a couple of weeks, and the worst thing is that when I drop them, they are impossible to find on my beige carpet.  The one I'm using has barely worn with at least 10 hours of playing on it.The size of the pick is the same as normal, it is just more tapered.  I tried to pick out stuff on the bass with it, but it was a little to much work as I dipped it too far into the strings, so I reverted back to a wider gator grip 1.14, which works better with the bigger strings. I am still searching for the world's perfect all-purpose pick. This works until then
