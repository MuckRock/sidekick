This pedal is remarkable for useful tones. The sound may not be for everyone, but i already have a Boogie for the really metal like distortion. I needed something that was different but still usable, and I feel this pedal fills the bill.  The low price tag didn't hurt my feelings either. This is a win-win buying decision as far as I am concerned.
