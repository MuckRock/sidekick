I swear by these strings. These are the only strings I will use on my Les Paul. Their bright tone sounds great and full, while the color coded ball ends makes restringing a breeze. Don't buy these strings just because I like them, buy them because they suit you. Because you like the tone they provide. Because they feel good against your fingers. Cons?? What cons...?? Try them.
