Very good reliable product to help keep track of your guitar picks.Only thing I can see negative about it is that you cannot fit very many picks inside of it.It does help to have a few stowed away for when you need them.I was not satisfied with the extent of time it took them to ship this product to me.It seemed to take forever although it has nothing to do with the product and only the vendor I ordered the product from.Dunlop has always created some very top quality products for guitar players.They have a great reputation and they uphold a high level of quality no matter what the product usually.This product AS ADVERTISED DID NOT come with any picks.If you order this and need picks MAKE SURE YOU ORDER PICKS SEPARATELY.
