This obviously is trying to copy the Kyser brand capo, and it does it pretty well. Feels a bit cheaper, which it actually is both monetary and quality wise. The cardboard insert in the package even has the &#34;lifetime guarantee&#34; but no info on where to mail it; and that's pretty hilarious that they tried to replicate that aspect, but other than that, it's a good cheap capo.
