- it's simple to operate- it does what it's made to do- it does that very well- it's bargaintasticIf you know what a noise gate is supposed to do and you think you might need one, then I highly recommend this unit.I'm about to get a second one and put all my distortion-creating devices in the loop (other Behringer units, Rat, Big Muff, etc etc). The one I already have can stay at the end of my signal chain, just before the delays. Pretty much a must-have for recording, especially during those quiet spots :-) Thanks to this unit I have a very quiet recording setup.
