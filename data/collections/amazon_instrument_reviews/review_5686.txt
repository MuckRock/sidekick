I picked these up on impulse &#8211; they were on a good sale and I was dissatisfied with my older, cheaper set of Panasonic over-the-ears.  I'm glad I did &#8211; these are excellent headphones and they've exceeded my expectations on just about every level.  The sound quality is exceptional and they do a very solid job of blocking external noise.  They feel extremely sturdy and well-made, from the cans themselves to the nice, thick coiled cord (although a removable cord would be a nice bonus).  Finally, and this is important, they're incredibly comfortable.  As a video editor, I often wind up wearing headphones for hours at a time.  The cans rotate on two axis, so they conform to the shape of your head and the headband is thick and well-padded.  They grip your head snugly, without that horrible &#34;vice grip&#34; feeling.I've heard several reviewers say that these are the best headphones to be found for under $200.  I haven't tried enough pairs to make that judgement, but I will say that I highly recommend them.  It's one of the best purchases I've made in a long time.
