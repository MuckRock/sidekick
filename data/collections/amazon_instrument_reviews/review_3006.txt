My experience with these straps has been great.  The polyester material is sturdy and comfortable, the leather post binding is sturdy and easy to use.  The straps have PET/ABS buckles and are easily adjusted.  I've not experienced any issues with the buckles breaking.Note: It is possible that this material can become brittle if stored in high heat (a car trunk or in sunlight within a hot car), but that problem isn't a manufacturing defect so much as a material deficit.For the price, the functionality is excellent.  If you are looking for a product for an everyday use guitar, with little investment or maintenance, this is it.
