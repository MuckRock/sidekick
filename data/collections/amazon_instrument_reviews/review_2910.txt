I started experimenting on strings, I'll try using bronze strings. I noticed when I was using the phosphor bronze, after a while it started to sound dull. When I switched to bronze it sounded better and lasted longer. I decided I would use bronze strings for my acoustic guitar for most of the time. I would recommend others to try it!
