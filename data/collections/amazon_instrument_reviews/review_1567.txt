These are nice,and this was easily the best price around. These are made in Japan, and I believe they're made for Fender by Gotoh, so they're good quality. But I was annoyed that they ( the bushings) didn't fit the "standard,vintage-sized" .340" holes in my All-parts neck ( they're a little large).So be aware of that.
