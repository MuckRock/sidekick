These are solid cables -- tight fit in receptacles, no introduction of noise, and no discernible loss of signal. Especially considering the price, these are brilliant. I was like some of the reviewers wondering if such an economical cable could be any good, but I trusted their judgment and gave these a try and so count me in among those who weren't sure but have become convinced that Hosa knows how to make a great cable, and to do so without the need to charge Monster Prices.
