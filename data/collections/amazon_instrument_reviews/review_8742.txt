I got this to compliment my filming of events, concerts etc. After my first test recording, when I played back the audio using the built-in speaker I really thought that I had been duped into believing this device was 'studio quality' ...Then I listened to that same test recording using headphones, and WOW!! This has got to be heard to be believed! There are so many applications for this recorder; it's ease of operation and quick start-up time make it ideal for hurried set-ups.
