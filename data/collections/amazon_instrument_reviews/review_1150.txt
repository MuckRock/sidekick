I have tried nearly every kind of popular strings out there. I've used ernie ball, fender, prs, just all kinds. When I bought my first real fender guitar it came with fender strings and I loved them. So when I needed more strings I just got fenders. I am happy to say that I will prolly never buy different kind of strings again. They are so clean sounding and have a pure vibe to them. GREAT strings.
