This tuner really delivers, its inexpensive and accurate , much better than the SN1. Do not be fooled by the broader gradients on the SN 8, if you are in the green , you are in tune. SN 8 is also far more reliable, no notorious having to adjust the neck to get a reading as in the SN 1 and 2. I use mine with ukulele and guitars, and both get tuned accurately with it.
