This works exactly as intended, and is a perfect size for my MS2000.  Not really sure what the going price is on other stands, but I'm very happy with what I paid for it.  No worries of my synth falling over or anything like that, the only issue I had was with putting it together at first.  The picture in the instructions was kind of hard to figure out, because there are different sized bars that were kind of difficult to interpret.  But it was probably more of my error, and even with that it just meant I had to unscrew them and screw in the right ones.
