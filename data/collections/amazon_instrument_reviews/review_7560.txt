I first bought the Yamaha MG102c mixer, but it arrived defective so I returned and bought this instead.First impression of ProFX8 is very good.  It's a lot more durable/heavy than the mg102c, and the knobs are constructed much better.For example, all the knobs that have centering dent on MG102c doesn't line up well, some are off by a few degrees.  But on this ProFX8 every dented knob line up beautifully pointing up.  Knob turning pressure is also consistent and firm.Really like the EQ on the Main output.  As well as mute on every channel.  Build-in FX effects are okay, you have to turn fx knob all the way up to feel anything.When using USB to do recording (with Audacity) there is noticeable buzz sound along side any recording, regardless if microphone channel is turned off or not.Microphone preamp is so-so I guess.  I have a AKG d5 and SM58, with both mics I have to turn gain and channel volume to 90% to get a decent output.But it does the function perfectly.  Runs a little bit on the hot side.  Power cable is kinda short, so you may want to look for a longer one.
