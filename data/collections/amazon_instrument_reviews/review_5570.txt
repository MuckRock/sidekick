Not bad at all, this unit tunes really well, same as the Boss original, the only difference is that this one takes like 1 sec to respond after the pedal is activated, the Boss is instantaneous, other than that both units behave exactly the same. Some criticize this brand for making cheap clones but the truth is that they are making musicians on a budget a great favor, for those of you who do not want to spend $100 on a tuner this one is just perfect; since I am a collector I have other brands to compare (Boss, Korg, Fender...) and it is the same thing, it is as accurate as the Boss , at least mine is, and is a good mute switch also, I am happy with mine....
