I've used these strings on all my acoustics and even gave some to a band mate.  They seem to keep their tone for a long time and don't change the instrument tone like some strings I've tried.  Like a lot of folks, I'm not that picky about my strings, but for those who are, this is a good light string that will sound great on your acoustic.
