I had read many reviews on SM57 clone microphones to see if there was anything that did the job. It seems everyone who has given an opinion on this subject all seemed to agree on one microphone. The GLS ES57. (Same with the SM 58/ES58). I had to give it a shot. I run the sound for local bands and I use SM's because they can take abuse and still sound great. Only time will tell if this mic will be able to take the same amount of abuse but so far I really like it. The frequency band is not identical to the SM57 as some others have said. A little less bass but that doesn't mean it is a thin sound - it certainly is not. I can get it to sound the same as the SM if I EQ it slightly but I like the natural sound anyway. Also, the signal is a bit hotter but I really like the tone for both vocals and for instruments. Value for money it can't be beat. If you are on a budget, get one....
