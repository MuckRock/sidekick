Just got this today and I'm experiencing serious install issues. Please note that I'm not a newbie to this stuff. I'm an IT guy. I have a new Acer computer that's less than 3 months old with a new install of Windows 7. The mic is recognized, but not as a sound input device, just as an "Other USB Device". I tried installing it on another laptop and it installed quickly and easily, so it's not that the mic itself doesn't work.My purpose in posting this is to let people considering this mic know that you can't just assume that the install is a no-brain'r (at least not on a PC). The Samson tech support was friendly enough, but not very helpful. They had no idea what to do next or any suggestions for further support. The support guy said, "well, that's really all there is to it", which I can understand...but I still have a $70 mic that won't work with my computer. I tried contacting Microsoft tech support and they tried to help me too, but we could never get the mic to be seen as an input device. We tried it a number of ways and nothing worked.I ordered this for use with my iPad as well, and I ordered the "camera kit" to do so. Despite what I'd seen in the reviews and videos online, the mic I received would work not with that either. The Mic needs to be powered by the iPad and it seemed mine was not getting enough power from the iPad because the little indicator light was still Amber when plugged in (indicating it's not getting enough power) instead of Blue.I tried this on my wife's iPad and my daughter's too so it would not appear to be the iPad that is the problem (though it could be the camera connector, I suppose.)So...I ended up returning the whole shooting match. Disappointing too...I really like the design of the mic and so many people say that it sounds so good.
