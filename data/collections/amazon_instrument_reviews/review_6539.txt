I bought this as for practice. I have a $180 amp, but was looking for something a little more portable. This is what I came to.It has great distortion, the effect is pretty awesome too! The lead cuts clean; &#34;mostly&#34;. In general is does tend to get a little noisy though. However. For the price, this is probably one of the best steals ever. Like I said, I have a &#34;sort-of&#34; name brand amp that is estimated at around $180. I can safely say that the sound quality of this item is about as good as the amp. Until I can afford a REALLY good amp, this will be my primary one; and really I have no problem with that.Pros:-Cheap Price-Fair sound quality-Nifty Built-in Effect-Can plug into AUX letting you play with musicCons:-Cheap ITEM quality-Distortion can get &#34;messy&#34;-Not very versatile...Metal ONLY.I hope it never breaks.
