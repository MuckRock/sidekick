Let me be upfront. I often use my electric guitar unplugged. When I am plugged in, I don't move around a lot. So this cord does not get a good frequent use and abusing. But no hum or noise and seems solid. It was very affordable. Can't say how it would perform if used live and in performance all the time, but for the price, I can not complain at all. I suspect it will always work good for me due to its light usage.
