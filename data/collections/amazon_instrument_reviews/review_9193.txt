I just put thePlanet Waves PW-CT-12 NS Mini Headstock Tuneron my Stratocaster last night. It replaces several other tuners I have been using that hung off the headstock and tended to come loose and fall off or had to be constantly re-secured and positioned (and removed/re-attached when I transferred my guitar to/from the case). The mini takes care of all those problems -- I attached it between the low E and A string tuners, inner facing with the display rotated to face me. It is sensitive and accurate. The display is quite readable, even without glasses and features a color change to green when near or in tune. There are fine tuning bars on either side of the note indicator so you know when you are right on. I can leave it attached when I case my guitar which is a huge plus. The battery is top loading so I don't even have to remove it to change the battery, which probably won't be for a while since it has an effective auto-shutoff function (as opposed to other tuners I've used that are supposed to shut-off when no audio energy present but don't and kill the battery). Also the display is smaller and as such, probably requires less power to operate which translates to longer battery life. It can be turned on (or manually turned off) with a simple touch of an easily palpated power button. The frequency is adjustable +/- 10 hz from 440 if you need that for some reason. It uses a clip to attach via friction, which is adjustable and the clip is padded so it won't scratch the finish of the headstock. I am so happy with this tuner I am buying TWO MORE immediately, one for my Breedlove acoustic, another to keep as a spare. Every once in a while I happen across products designed to fill a specific niche that fill their designated need perfectly and this is one of them.
