its good but not fitting my requirement, but its extremely recommend it for beginners because it is very easy to play and bend.. but for me as a reggae rhythm guitar its not good and not warm enough and i have one point on the G string specially if you want to lead and solo whenever you start bending you will notice how annoying its because its hard to keep in tune while bending if you used to medium G size
