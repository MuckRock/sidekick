All I can say is, sometimes you get more than what you paid for. While this isn't the new break through tech or the rave of the much, much higher end mics, it does deliver. With a decent mixer you can get a very nice response. Been giggin' since the early 70's and have been hosting an open-mic to boot. I get some seasoned players that grace my stage and none were the wiser of this very nice, super affordable microphone ... it's a charm! 'b' B
