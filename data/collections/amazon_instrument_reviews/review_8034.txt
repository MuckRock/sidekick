The gooseneck holds its position well when adjusted into place in front of the microphone.  Also, the clamp works well.  However, the gooseneck initially made some snapping sounds when flexing it - that now seems to be in the past, generally; perhaps, it's a tubing issue.I have yet to try the pop filter with my microphone.
