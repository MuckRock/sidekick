Another excellent gadget from Planet Waves. What a great idea. Already has made my life easier. Keep a pile of Jazz IIIs in the concave pocket (shallow depression for holding stuff). I don't own any very expensive guitars, so I'm not concerned about resting their bodies on my carpet. The guitar rest simply makes your guitar more accessible, and that means... you're more apt to grab your axe and play more.When un-weighted by the guitar neck, the Rest itself is rather light and can move around easily. No big deal at all.*****************************EDIT: Just purchased another one -- an axe close at hand is an axe you will play. That's been my experience. After living with this for a few days one thing has become an annoyance: when there's no guitar holding it to the table, it's very easy to knock it off the desk. The way it is designed is such that the leverage has a see-saw effect that will have it fly a few feet across the room. Because it sticks out horizontally, just a nudge with a knee and there it goes. So if you have picks or anything sitting in the round holder area, it can be an annoyance.I do use these for my guitars, but I feel much more comfortable using a proper stand. The product is worthwhile for a quick location for setting down your axe without searching for a stand.If the product had a way of either using suction or tab to secure itself to a surface it would earn another star.
