As a beginner guitarist, a few friends let me try out their picks.  I was displeased with most of the standard picks, partially because I didn't like that flimsy feel to them and their sound just didn't sound quite as robust as I like (hopefully, that makes sense).  However, when I was handed one of these, it produced a pleasant sound and I didn't feel like I would somehow break the pick while playing.Needless to say, now that I have my own guitar, I ordered a pack of these and I am certainly not disappointed.
