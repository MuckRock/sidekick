Was very pleased with JP 600L PB acoustic guitar strings. I wipe the strings with a Planet Waves microfiber cloth each time after playing and it seemed like they would last forever. Plus the tone of the bass strings was improved over the D'Addario EJ16 light I had been using that were installed by the factory, so I kept replacing with like kind. 600L is the exact same string gauges.I read a review on Shorline Music (an Amazon affiliate) about the John Pearse 710 NM PB and after trying those I like them even better than the 600L. They keep most of the same bass strings as the 600L (A, D, and G) but add some strings from the medium size: low E (.055 replacing .053) and high E and B each increasing .001, from .012 to .013, and .016 to .017.I had a concern about my ability to bend the B string using little finger only in blues F chord position - no problem.The improvement in tone is in all the right places. Very nice. Yet the overall tension of the set is increasing only very slightly under 10 pounds total, from the 162.2 lbs. for the D'Addario light.I play fingerstyle only and this set is said to be ideal for fingerstyle offering a balanced tension across all strings.I suppose things are always subject to change, but for now, I am amazed and delighted with these strings. You wouldn't think a simple string change could make much of a difference, but somehow these do.
