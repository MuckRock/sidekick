What I like about these spongy little things, besides protecting the internals of the mic, is that you can pick a color that reflects your mood according to the song you're singing. Just like a pink jail cell works to impart a sense of calm to the incarcerated, so too can a colorful mic cover. And my neighbor kids just love 'em during our singalongs!
