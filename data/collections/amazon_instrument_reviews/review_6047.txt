I'm very happy with this pedal.  It seems to be a knock off of the MXR phase pedal, being that it provides a nice classic, subtle phase effect.  You can flip the switch to "swirl" for a more pronounced effect, but I love just keeping it mild.The metal switch/button to engage the pedal doesn't have the "click" that many pedals do.  I actually prefer this.  The "click" effects wear out sooner.  Some of my high end pedals also use this smooth, click-less way of engaging a pedal.  You'll know it's on by the tone change and the bright led light.  IMHO, you don't need a click switch.The sounds are clean and smooth, clear and bright, and all the other adjectives you could use to describe a great phase effect.Quality and Value, all the way.
