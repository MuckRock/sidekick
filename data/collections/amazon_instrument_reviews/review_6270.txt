I use the chair for guitar, bass, keyboards,ukulele and even cooking breakfast. Lightweight, slightly awkward, but provides good back support.As a right-handed player I practice, both classical and jazz style, with the guitar on my left knee. For the position I use in this chair it is necessary to use the On Stage FS7850B Guitar Foot Rest. I do this to keep my thumb in the center of guitar neck. I can report that I have been very comfortable for long practice sessions.As for the four out of five star review, the price does seem steep when you look at what you get for $85. But it's a nice design and thank you to the designer. I would recommend it to those who can afford it.As for durability..... we shall see. I have had it for three months now and it is still fine.  I use it daily.
