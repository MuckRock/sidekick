Just a bag for my guitar stand. No big deal, but it sure makes it easier when I have all that stuff to lug around. I love my Hercules guitar stands, but they a don't like to stay put when folded up. This takes care of that problem for a couple of bags. Sturdy material, nice draw string to close it up. Shoulder strap works just fine. Glad I bought it.
