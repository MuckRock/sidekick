This is fine for my music room at home where it isn't likely to get bumped too hard.  I wish the bottom didn't swivel, because I don't see a need for it to do that.  But it keeps my guitar handy and does the job I wanted it to do at a low price.  I like the security strap that keeps the neck from falling out.  However, I wouldn't recommend this for the stage where there are crowded conditions and it is more likely to suffer a heavy bump.  For that, you would want a larger tripod at the bottom to make it less likely to topple.
