This mic stand is a great value! This stand is very sturdy and it can to adjust to any length needed. I bought a few years back and it's still working amazing till this day. If you're purchasing a mic soon, you will need one of these stands. Just make sure that your mic comes with a shock mount because the stand tends to move a little but other than that, it's a great buy!
