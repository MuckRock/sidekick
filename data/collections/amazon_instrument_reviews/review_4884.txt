Do not let the size fool you. This is a very handy piece of equipment and it's so easy to set up and use. Just plug a 1/4 inch stereo cable into your sub out on your mixer and then into the HA400, then plug in up to 4 pairs of headphones and your set to track overdubs. This is perfect for a small home studio on a budget and it's built like a tank. Be forewarned that this a very basic headphone distribution system, you can only adjust volume from the HA400 and it would be wise to purchase a real long 1/4 stereo cable and extensions for the headphones if you want to isolate vocals.
