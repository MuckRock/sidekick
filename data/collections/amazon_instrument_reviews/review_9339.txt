I purchased the DR-40 for use in field recordings for found sounds and other sampling needs, and it accomplishes that very well.  The battery life is great, the user interface can be a little confusing at first but is very fluid once you get used to it, and the build quality is pretty solid.  My only issue is the internal mics, while crystal clear in terms of quality, can sometimes be lacking on the gain side of things.  In addition, they are VERY susceptible to wind, even if you just move the recorder while it is recording you will hear a rush of air.  I highly suggest picking up a wind screen at the same time and save yourself the trouble of having to make another delivery.
