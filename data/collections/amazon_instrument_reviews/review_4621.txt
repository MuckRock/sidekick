This was recommended by a guitar repair shop, and I have found it is a well rounded product that all guitar players should keep on hand.  It will polish, and lube things like Floyd Roses.  Do your strings get funky from the acid in your skin oil?  Wipe them down with a little DR. Duck's Ax wax before you place your guitar back in the case.  The secret is always use the least you can get away with.  Too much for polishing and you will be rubbing it off forever.
