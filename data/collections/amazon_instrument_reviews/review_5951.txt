hey rockers!!!  DON'T HESITATE BUY IT bEHRINGER IS A GREAT EFFECT IT IS MADE IN GERMANY ,, THAT SHOULD EXPLAIN ITS ENGINEERING ,, THE ONLY BAD THING IS THAT IS PLASTIC,, BUT DON'T LET THAT FULL UR EAR!!! THE effects put out same as some of the older brands ,,, i trust Behringer , i get more in tone and sound then what i payed for 100%,,,, this chorus is a wonderful effect and has a lot of color to the tone this effect is made well with thought behind it ,, and versatility as well... i say buy it. iv been using all kinds of brand effects ,, and at the end of the day like everything else you pay for the name,, and some times what u get may not value its name ,, that's why behringer proves that with its effects ..
