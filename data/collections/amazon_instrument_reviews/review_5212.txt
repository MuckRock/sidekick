My bass-playing has gone on for 50 years,...and during the time I've tried lots of strings on my many bass guitars.  I know from that experience how the quality and construction of strings has improved over the decades.This set of D'Addario chromes is remarkable.  It's a flat wound string with all the smoothness and quiet character found in that string type.  In this set, I especially like the 4th string at .100&#34; dia. This set, by its design, gives a very strong and powerful signal to the amp,...and therefore makes even my Schecter Diamond Series 4-string sound largely like the early P-bass with bottom to spare.  There's a 'however'.... and this is it,....this string is NOT muddy sounding like many flat wounds.  Clean, bold, and full of smooth overtones that work well.  I really like them.  The price is fair, and we'll see what kind of life they exhibit, as I don't want to be spending lots of hard-to-find cash on new strings at a frequency that is aggravating.Don P.
