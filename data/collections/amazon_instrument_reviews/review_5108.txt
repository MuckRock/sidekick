For the price, I got a little more than expected. The sound is pretty great. The scoop switch gives you a slightly different sound. Other than that your can change amount of distortion. Its cheap, and maybe it doesn't have alot of fancy versatility with the settings and whatnot. But for the price this is one hell of a deal! Quality item.Only complaints are; its so little sometimes just accidentally moving the cable will flip it around or something. But thats expected, and not that big of a deal if you're careful. Now the one issue I really have with this pedal, its cosmetic so its not worth 4-starring this review; but it did get to me. The knobs. They are not the cool chrome ones in these pictures. They are black plastic ones. They look sorta bland and not as cool, but ive noticed no functionality problems with them yet. Still a great product though.
