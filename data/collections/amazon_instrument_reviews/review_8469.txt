I LOVE THIS AMP. Here are the reasons: Solidly made, everything is high quality.  Best of all it comes with Fender Fuse software whereby you can hook it up to your PC using the USB cable (included) and &#34;control&#34; all of the amps features over and above the actual settings on the amp(without even touching the knobs) INCLUDING special effects like various stomp box add-ins, effects like reverb, distortion, phaser, factory presets on the dials etc and you can even select different amps on the PC screen visually. You can also go online through the app and download presets other people have created. If you want to play a Pink Floyd song you can download a David Gilmour preset and there you go. You got your Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall preset ready to go.  This is so cool and 20 watts beats 10 and works for me.  I can record directly from the amp into my PC Mixpad software program.
