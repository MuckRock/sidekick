The Korg CM-100L Clip On Contact Microphone For Tuners is a great product.  I would recommend it to anyone needing to tune an instrument.  My instructor, who has been playing a violin for about 40 years, brought one to my private lesson recently.  Because it did not pick up extraneous room noises, it made tuning my violin for the lesson so much faster and easier.
