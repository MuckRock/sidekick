I'm a bassist, and am familiar with the flat/round/half-round debate on BASSES (I prefer flats). Anyway, my son wanted these for his Epiphone Casino because he heard John Lennon used (a different brand of) flat-wounds. They sound AMAZING! They make that Casino ring like a carillon, yet will get &#34;down & dirty&#34; when called for. A VERY &#34;different&#34; sound range than round wounds. In fact, it's about time to order another set or three....
