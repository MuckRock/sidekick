I have mine attached to one of the support arms on myOn Stage KS8291XX Pro Double X Keyboard Stand. While this attachment is designed for both square and round tube supports, I was unable to use it with anOn Stage 2 Tier Folding Z Keyboard Standeven with the top tier removed. The reasons for the problem with the latter stand is the friction fitting on the attachment bar was too small for the oblong support tube, and had it mated, the height of the attachment bar would not have cleared the top of the keyboard.When attached to theOn Stage KS8291XX Pro Double X Keyboard Standwith anOn Stage MSA7040TB Adjustable Microphone Boom, Blackattached to the top screw-in post that perfectly mates with the boom, this attachment bar/boom combination easily clears the height of either keyboard I use (aRoland RD-300NX Digital Stage Pianoor aRoland V-combo 76 Key Stage Keyboard).Bottom line, make sure your stand can accommodate this attachment bar (according to the manufacturer it will work with most X-style stands), and carefully measure the height of the top of your keyboard from the center of the support arm to which this attachment bar will be inserted. The total height of the attachment bar after insertion is approximately 7.5".  If your keyboard is still too high for the attachment bar + boom or other mic holder to clear, you can gain an additional 3" with aShure A26X 3" Mic Mount Extension Tube.
