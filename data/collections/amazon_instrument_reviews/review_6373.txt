I had looked around for strap locks for my Dean Dime Razorback, and was not happy to see that most locking mechanisms were designed with a button on top to release them.  My guitar straps attach on the rear and underside of the guitar which would be easy to accidentally press when the guitar hits my waist causing unknown horrible damage.Then I saw these and knew they were perfect for my situation.  I installed them last night and could not be happier.  They are very solid and the lock is 'positive' so you can feel the click when it is set.  I am sure they will work well if your guitar straps mount in the traditional spots as well.  This is a great product at a good price.Note:  If you are installing on a Dean Razorback or ML, the stock front strap mount screw goes through the plate, body into the neck....DO NOT USE this to mount, or pull the old strap mount off and return the screw...it is too long and will likely split your neck.  Just drill a hole right next to it and install the locking mount right next to it (it can touch it even and still function properly).  Enjoy!  I really am happy that my guitar is much more secure now and don't worry that I will hurt my favorite guitar.
