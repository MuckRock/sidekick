I have used Ernie Ball strings on my Les Paul for quite a while, Slinkys mostly.  I recently bought a Yamaha FG700S and quickly found that the high E string had a very "tinny" tone.  I searched the net to see if this was comon with this model, alas I found that it is.So I decided to try some different strings to see if it would help.  I ordered a set of Earthwood Lights and installed them last night.Wow, what a difference.  First the tone is much softer on the E string, second the action feels much more comfortable on strings 1 thru 3.  The strings that came on the guitar were Yamaha light strings but they were very stiff, especially the B string.  After a hour of playing with the Earthwood strings last night they were much more enjoyable, both tonally and physically.  Not sure how they will last, time will tell.Good strings I would recommend them.
