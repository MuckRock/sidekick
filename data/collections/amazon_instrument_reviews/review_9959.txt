I couldn't be happier with my choice to buy this product over the many others listed on Amazon. This was a newly listed item on Amazon when I bought it, (in fact this review will be the first), so I was a little apprehensive about choosing something that had no user feedback, but I'm glad I decided on this item.I wanted something with several storage compartments, so I could organize all my guitar accessories in the case properly. This bag has six separate compartments for storage - three main zipped compartments, each also with a zipped pocket for smaller items. Perfect! I also needed some new plectrums and this particular case came with a nice quantity bundled, as well as a guitar strap that I don't currently require as I already have one, but it's nice to have a spare now.The padding of the bag is quite thin, but firm, so is more than adequate enough to protect my guitar from bumps during transport and carrying. The two built in "back-pack" straps will certainly be useful when traveling with other luggage, and the case also comes with grip sized carry handles both on the front and the side ensuring the guitar can be carried however a user wishes to.If you are in the market for a guitar bag and don't want to spend a fortune, I would definitely recommend you consider this item. It is perfect for my requirements, and may well be for yours too.
