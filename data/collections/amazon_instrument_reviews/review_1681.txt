I just received the case today, the soonest delivery day on the estimation range (a plus there!).  Now having spent a long time pricing hard cases from all around internet, this price is extremely reasonable and a wonderful case.  Nothing fancy and differs slightly from the pictured item in that the outside rim-threading and basic locks (keys included) are gold toned (instead of silver toned pictured), but that doesn't mean diddly-squat to me.  Plush interior with a small, yet roomy, compartment located under the neck.  I am primarily a 5-string banjo player, but decided to casually play around with the mandolin, and so I figured I had better get a hard case for possible "long-time" storage (my first banjo lived in a padded gig bag for a few years before I started getting serious with it... and boy, not the best thing for it in small enclosed storage spaces).  This case will definitely do the trick.  Excellent value!- Additional note, there is a bit of extra play around the peg-head (I have an Rover mandolin)... I can see if someone traveled with this case and dropped it hard it enough, some peg snapping may occur.  But again, for simple storage/protection, its a non-issue.
