For the money, this is one of the best products I've reviewed.  I went ahead and ordered two and before I even had a chance to buy them, the price dropped by a dollar or so.  They easily fit on your mic stand and save you the hassle of trying to bend over and find your pick once you drop it.  Definitely a smart buy.  Don't play another show without these!
