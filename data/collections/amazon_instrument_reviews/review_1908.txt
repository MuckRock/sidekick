First of all, I use this as more of a 6 band EQ using the lower and highest more for LP and HP filters.  The middle four have the most dramatic effect on the tone.  You can also use this as boost box, using the gain and volume sliders.  The box is solid and fairly easy to manipulate on stage, but I tend to set and forget.In reviewing other posts maybe these bullets may be helpful.-If you turn your gain way up, you will have hiss.  Period, this holds true for any effect box or amp that has a gain on it that I have been exposed to.  Have a reason for upping your gain, if it is to add volume consider doing this on your guitar or amp.-EQ is to ENHANCE your tone, not create it!  A Strat cannot be made to sound like a Les Paul and vice versa.  Your tone is made up of many, many variables.  The resulting tone can be SHAPED or COLORED by adding or subtracting certain frequencies.  That is the function of an EQ, nothing more.  IT can range from dramatic to very subtle.  Very small changes can have large effects.  Small bumps in the higher range really enhance the harmonics I am able to produce.-I tend to put the EQ in much later in my effect chain, but feel free to experiment.
