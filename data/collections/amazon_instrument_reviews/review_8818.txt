I really like the Cherub pickup. It is the easiest to install in my classical guitar of any pickup I've used. The sound quality is very good for a piezo pickup and better than at least one of the more complicated bar type in the sound hole type pickups I have. The pick wire out to the amp is skinny and only 8 feet long, but for 8 bucks it can't be beat.
