I am normally a guitarist in my band, but I have found myself at times needing to play the keys also. Having two instruments to play, a pedalboard, and mic stand is a lot of real estate on the stage, so this adapter made things MUCH better for me when I find myself back in that position. Works great with my On Stage Keyboard Stand. If you play keys and are also a vocalist, this is a must! Worth every penny.
