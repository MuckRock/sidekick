This was something I HAD to pick up, simply due to the price.  I own a Shure SM57 and compared to this, the sound is very close, not dead on, but I'd consider this over other mics for someone on a budget.The  top does not spin like the Shure and the weight is much lighter due to the material used to cut cost I'm sure, but none the less, it makes no difference sound wise.Overall, a great buy!
