The Planet Waves Capo looks like it should work a lot better than it did. I tried it on several guitars and made direct comparisons with several other Capos. I used this capo on a Gibson J40, Hummingbird and a J-200. I played it finger style and strummed with a pick. The device is very well made and really looks like the best capo I own. However, the sound left something to be desired. There was fret buzz and the notes sounded lifeless, unless  I really cranked down on the adjustment - then is was still dull, but passable. It was a little better on electrics - I tried it on a Les Paul and a Telecaster - it was OK, but not the best of the bunch. I do like the built in pick holder. To compare this I tried a G7 capo, Kaiser and Schubb. Frankly, the only one I really am happy with is the Schubb.
