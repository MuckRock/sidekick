Bought this as a back-up to my AT system and have only tried it in my living room. Home tests show it works fairly well in that environment although I think I hear a little distortion if I turn the gain up too much (I don't think you can change the gain on the AT system). My only nitpick is that I'll need to use an adapter to go from the guitar plug to a 1/8&#34;. For the price, it's amazing. I just hope it works in the field as well.
