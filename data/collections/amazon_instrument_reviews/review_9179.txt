I own several small tuners, including the Enote nano tuner and the Snark. In comparison to those, I would say its most like the Enote when it comes to size, but definitely more accurate and responsive.  In comparison to the Snark, its not as quick to respond but still does an adequate job tuning.  Its a great size and fits nicely in the pocket of a gig bag and isnt quite as large as the Snark. Anyway, it all comes down to preference I suppose.  I would recommend it.
