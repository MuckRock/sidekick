when given a budget for cheap microphones, the odds are that you cant afford to make a mistake by buying this one. I like the fact that it adds a deeper, bassier tone to any voice but it's missing clarity. If you want the low tone but also treasure your clarity, spend 30 dollars less and get an MXL 990 instead. it even comes with its own shockmount and carrying case. I hooked the 990 up to a cheap ART Tube MP preamp and after letting a few vocalists experiment with it, they agreed that the 990 was clearly superior to the V67G that was hooked up to much more expensive preamp. Some vocalists actually prefer the MXL 990 over a couple of my Shure condenser microphones.
