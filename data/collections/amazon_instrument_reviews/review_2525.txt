I use this when myOn Stage Microphone 13-inch Gooseneck, Blackare too long for what I want to do. Sometimes - on rare occasions - I have used this to extend the length of the 13" model.The mic I mainly use this with is aNady DM70 Drum and Instrument Microphone, which is small, relatively light, and works with saxophones as well as drums and cymbals. When I am using that mic for alto and tenor sax, I use anOn Stage MY550 Microphone Extension Attachment Barto clamp to the pole of a regular microphone stand, and attach the gooseneck and DM70 without using a separate mic stand.Because this and its bigger sibling are so versatile I keep a few of each size around, plus a supply of extra extension attachment bars. In some situations they can be a savior during set up.  I will empahsize, though, that anything larger than the DM70 or DM80 (which is slightly larger and heavier), and this may not hold your mic in place.
