These are my favorite brand of strings.When i was a beginner a few years back these were the 1st strings i bought on my electric (since i used them on my acoustic) And i have to say, elixir is my favorite brand of strings. They last long, are easy to tune, & have a nice bright sound & if you take proper care of them (wipe them down when your done playing, keep the guitar in your gig bag when your not using it, ETC.) that bright sound can last about 6 MONTHS OR MORE!! i usually just buy about two sets a year & im a HEAVY player i play about 2-7 hours EVERYDAY. I love the coating aswell but the medium gauge & up usually don't have that other coating you can get on the light gauge strings, but overall these strings are awesome & are a must buy for every guitarist!
