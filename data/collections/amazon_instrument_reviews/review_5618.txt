I have many heavy guitars.  Yet wide guitar straps are for old men and blues posers.  I'm neither.  However, my back was still hurting, and I'm definitely a weakling.  So I bought this shoulder pad.  Now I only look like a weakling to the more eagle-eyed people who see me play guitar.  Thanks Planet Waves!Really, though, it's quite good.
