I have an electronic indoor/outdoor thermometer that shows relative humidity and a whole house humidifier.It is interesting to see just how quickly relative humidity changes inside and outside with that electronic thermometer.The whole house humidifier pumps out about 3 gallons of water a day into a 1500 sq ft house during the fall and winter keeping the indoor humidity around 47%.This makes the house feel warmer and makes my breathing easier. Makes the whole house safer for the Martins.Now you can use a little in the case humidifier like this to help with humidity, but I think you really need a whole house solution and a monitor system.A sponge in a zip lock bag with a few holes works well too. Just don't get water on the wood.And don't forget to take the silica gel packs out of the little accessory compartment in the case. Many guitars come shipped with these and their job is to remove humidity from the case.All the better acoustic guitar shops I go to have a big humidifier running in their showrooms.
