The issue isn't whether it sounds exactly like a &#34;Tube Screamer&#34;, the issue (for me at least) is, does it sound good? Is it musical? Does it sound like an overdriven amp?I say it does. It sounds great for blues and rock. I've only had it for a couple weeks and I hope that it continues to work well for a long time. I've heard that these can be fragile, but I'm pretty gentle with my gear. If it breaks, I'll post about it.
