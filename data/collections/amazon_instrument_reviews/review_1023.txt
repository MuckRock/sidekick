This is just what it looks like - a very economical strap.  The great thing about it is the length.  As any other tall person will tell you, finding a strap that adjusts to longer than normal can be frustrating.  This strap is very long, if you need it to be.  For the price, very hard to beat this.  Works well withDunlop Dual Design Straplok System, Blacktoo.  Overall, a good buy, for a backup strap or your primary.
