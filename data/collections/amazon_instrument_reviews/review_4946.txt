Sound just like an Ibanez Tube Screamer to me. Many seem to complain about the plastic housing but, I'm fine with it. Seem durable and plastic has proven to be pretty strong in many products so... Sounds great but I also have a Berhinger Ultra Metal that I think kill for a high gain metal sound better than this. Note I use it with a Marshall JMC800 head, a Marshall JMP head and a Crate Blue Voodoo head and these pedal sound excellent. I've got some videos on YT if you search UM300, JMP800 and Blue Voodoo out.
