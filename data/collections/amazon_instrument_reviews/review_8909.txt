I love this tuner... I have other similar models, and they are all great.don't hesitate to get one.These are three times as high at guitar center.  how ridiculous.ok.. this may sound silly, but just to let you know you can do it.if you hold a stick or something similar touching your throat, and clip this tuner to it, you can tune your voice with it.even holding your thumb against your voicebox and clip this on your finger will do it.cracks me up, but fun to play with
