I've been learning for a little over a year and have had this capo for about that long . Though my playing still isn't very strong , the capo still is. I don't use it hardly at all but when I do I usually end up playing around with it quite a bit. My point being it gets tested more than the amount of times I use it. It's simply engineered of fairly heavy duty design so I don't expect any issue at anytime soon.
