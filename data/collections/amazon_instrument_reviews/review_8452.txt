This delay is really nice, especially for the price.  I am a fan of the FAB line of effects and have several of them.  My favorite is this delay and the Echo.  They have been very durable and I am confident that the plastic body of the pedals will remain durable.  My only complaint is the markings on the level knobs.  They have a very thin pale red line that is hard to see.  This could have been more thoughtfully desingned with a thick bright white line that would contrast against the knob surface.  This can be done yourself with a paint marker or whiteout brush, but it should have been considered ahead of time.
