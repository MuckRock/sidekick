This is an amazing guitar. I couldn't put it down, I have experience playing really, really expensive guitars. My $500 "beater" acoustic I was just going to take to the beach and stuff actually got warped and never played well at all, I couldn't imagine what I would b getting for $90. By was I wrong. It's my best acoustic currently! This thing sounds like, sustains, and holds its' own tune like a similar $2000.00+ Martin model and that's ZERO exaggeration! Get it and see, you will be blown away. I bought a second one. I just wish I had found this guitar sooner.
