Just recently a few months back got my first tube amp, wanted a good analog delay pedal to go with it I found that the digital delay pedals left something to be desired at least for my ears.After a lot of research and reading reviews I decided to give this Pedal a try.All I can say is wow!It has excellent sound quality ,very low noise while off it is transparent in your petal chain.The settings are outstanding, you will not be disappointed very well-made.
