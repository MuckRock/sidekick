I usually use Gibson Vintage Nickle Strings on my electric guitars but when I had an opportunity to try theses strings out I jumped at the chance. I put them on a Gibson Les Paul Goldtop guitar with P-90 pickups. I had no trouble installing them and they tuned up pretty quickly without a lot of stretching needed. They had some great &#34;spank&#34; and sounded great. Easy to play (they almost seemed thinner than advertised - they play like 9's but sounded like tens). I am really happy with these and will probably buy them on occasion instead of the Gibson strings. Next I want to try a set on a Strat and see how they sound - I suspect they will sound and play great!
