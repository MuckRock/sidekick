I ended up ordering this cable to connect a 535Q Wah into a Dyna Comp on my Pedaltrain 2 board. It's the perfect length, as the 1/2 foot cable was just a little bit too short. Since then, I've ordered these patch cable in other lengths, and they've done a great job of cleaning up the look of my pedalboard.
