You get a 10" speaker and separate drive control volume with this amp; try to findthose two capabilities in another amp for around $90.00!!!!!!!!!!!!This is by far the best practice amp I have found in the past 10 years and I owna butt load of new amps.I have actually upgraded to a Champion 40, but still use this amp as much as the 40.Don't even think about it, this is one of the best (under $100.00) practice amps, unless you are looking for a gadget filled amp, and in that case you should look elsewhere, as this one is forturning on and going for it and not fiddling around with digital controls until you havejust lost most of your practice time.As an addendum, I would like to add that you should probably not try to replace the speakeras I have read from other reviewers. I have a few of these amps, so just for the heck of it,I put in a Celestion G10 Greenback (which costs more than the 25R) and was very disappointed withthe results.This amp is not being carried by a lot of retailers now, but can still be had new for under $100.00 if you just do an internet search.
