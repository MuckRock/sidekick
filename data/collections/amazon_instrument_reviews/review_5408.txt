I've been using a One Spot to power a Gator small pedalboard for about 8 years now.  In that time I've done probably over 200 gigs and I've never had a problem.  Is it super quiet?  No, but when you have pedals and amps with gain and single coil pickups, there will be noise.  It's a fact of life.  I've never found it to be excessive.  Turn the volume on your guitar all the way down when you're not playing.I would recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable solution to powering their pedalboard.
