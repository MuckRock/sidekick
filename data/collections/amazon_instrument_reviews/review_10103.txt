My first review was a knee-jerk reaction to this amp as it had no manual with it.  I couldn't get it to sound like I wanted it to.....I WAS SO WRONG IN GIVING IT ONLY 2 STARS...I must now rerate it with a 5 star.  This amp does almost too much for the money.  My only wish is that a manual came with it as you really need to spend some serious time playing with it to see the depth this thing has.  It can do ANYTHING and sound any way you want it too.WOW, I never knew my guitar could sound like this.  It actually gives you any sound or personality you want it to have.  I am beginning to love this thing and it will surely be my favorite Amp when I totally figure it out, if I ever do.  The sound production is endless as there are so many setting and different combinations of settings.So, in short, forgive me as I have sinned and judged too early.  BUY this thing but give yourself some time to familiarize yourself with it.  If you are looking for a small, plug and play amp...this isn't it.  But it you're looking for a powerful sound with endless possibilities. this IS it.  It is growing on me and I wouldn't part with it now.
