I am just learning the mandolin and bought this as a afterthought and I am glad I did, I am a longtime guitar player and the way you hold a pick for a guitar and for a mandolin are totally different combine this with the twin string setup on the mandolin and how close the twin strings are to each other and I have suddenly developed a case of the clumsys as far as keeping hold of my pick, its bad enough dropping my pick in the middle of a jam session but it would be worse having to go fishing around for it or a replacement, I stuck this on the back of my mandolins head between the strap and the tuners so when I drop my pick I just flick a new one out and continue on.
