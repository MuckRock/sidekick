I bought this in lieu of the more expensive Lee Oskar rack. I'm not a regular rack player and just wanted something to experiment with. This rack is constructed better than I had really expected. It's easy to adjust. However, I found the fit around my neck and the angle of the harmonica to be a bit awkward. Getting he harmonica unto te spring-loaded holder can be a bit tricky. Still, this is a good deal.
