Not sure how to rate this tube? Replaced a Chinese preamp tube in my Champion 600 and couldnt tell any difference in tone. Maybe it is built better? But thats yet to be seen. I did put a EH6V6 in with the Chinese preamp tube and did notice an improvement but the EH6V6 only lasted five minutes and shorted out. So i sent it back. I ordered a TS 6V6 and am still waiting for it. Maybe NOS is the way to go with the preamp tubes? Time will tell.
