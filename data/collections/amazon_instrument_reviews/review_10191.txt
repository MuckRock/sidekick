I own Dunlop, Kyser and G7th Nashville Capos.  I don't like the direction the Dunlop faces, it seems awkward.  The Kyser spring is very poplar, but I think the spring tension is too strong, making it harder to take on and off and I think it makes the strings a little sharp.  I like the G7th Nashville Capo, but the spring tension is inconsistent.  The used to be softer, maybe too soft, but the lastone I bought was almost as still as the Nashfille.  Ths Planet Waves NS Artist Capo is similar to the Kyser and Nashville Capos, but the tension is adjustable and seems to be the best of all combinations. Only downside is I think the Nashville capo looks better.
