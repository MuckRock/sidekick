What makes it better is that it is a kit with most of what you need to power up to 8 pedals.  It comes with various adapters and even has rubber caps to cap of the power outlets you arent using! Powers pedals that have negative tip -like boss, maxon, ibanez, etc, etc.  Even has one reverse adapter for an oddball positive tip pedal!  Also adatper to connect your battery only pedal by connecting to the battery clip!!!One of the best features is that the power plugs are at right angles so they don't stick straight out on pedals that have side jacks...takes up less room on your pedal board.  Also the 8 plugs stretch further out than most other daisy chain cables.The other great feature is the power capacity is greater than boss..it can put out up to 1700mA...which is how it can run up to 8 pedals.A great item at a great price. No brainer solution for anyone with a few pedals or more.
