I received a MIM Stratocaster as a gift a year ago. Recently, I noticed the occasional moment where no signal would make it to the amp. After tracing the issue, I discovered there was some play in the Strat's jack and the right angle of pull on the cable would keep it from making a positive connection with the tip. A quick fix was to bend the jack's connector end, but the root of the problem was substandard metal that had too much flex and would permanently open, making a minor gap where there wasn't that positive connection.I've purchased several Switchcraft jacks and they just work. Stronger, more flexible metal, easy soldering, good materials. It's a very wise investment and makes a trustworthy connection. Obviously, because the finish is chromed, oxidation can get in the way of the connection, but that only happens after a few years of use and can easily be remedied. If oxidation/wear is an issue, Switchcraft makes gold-plated jacks. However, I just love these jacks, and for the price, they really can't be beat.
