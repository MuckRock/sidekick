These strings are as advertised.  Nice tone and good quality.  Can't remember the last time I've found a bad string from a set of these.  Actually prefer the medium tension for a 650mm scale guitar.  Got the high tension ones for a shorter scale instrument so they wouldn't be too sloppy at concert pitch.
