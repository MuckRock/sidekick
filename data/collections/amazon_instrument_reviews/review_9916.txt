I needed a new stand for my home studio so I thought I was cutting corners when I purchased this one. As it turns out, this stand is practically indistinguishable from myBelmonte Orchestra Stand Deluxein construction and material quality. That stand sells for twice the price of this one at the time of this review.The stand is adjustable enough for sitting or standing musicians, and is stable enough to use outside. The rest/tray mechanism holds a lot of weight without losing any adjustments. In fact, I have attached anAleratec Universal Tablet Mountto hold an iPad with sufficient room left over for a 438 page copy of theThe New Real Book - Volume 1and it holds those rock steady.Another feature that I like is the legs can be configured like a tripod with varying angles, which is useful for outdoors with light breezes that would knock over lighter stands. Or you can set the legs flush for maximum stability if space and the stand's footprint are not problems.Bottom line: this is a professional grade stand at a student stand price. I am thoroughly pleased with it and if ever I need another stand this is the model I will purchase.
