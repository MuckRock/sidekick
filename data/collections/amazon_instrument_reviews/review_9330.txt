I have been using an app on my cell phone until I purchased this from Amazon.  This thing is awesome. It's so cool that you just clip it from guitar to guitar and not have to worry about plugging anything in to it.  Oh and it turns itself off after 60 seconds of no sound.  It does get a little sensitive when tuning, in the sense of that it is easy to go past your mark.  But the more I use it, the better feel I get for it.  If you don't have one, get one.
