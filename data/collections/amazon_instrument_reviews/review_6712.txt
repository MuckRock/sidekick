These picks come in a large range of sizes, but most of them are way too thick to play any guitar with.There is a really funny smell to these when you first use them that gets on your fingers, but it goes away after a bit.They seem to be decent quality. The thin picks have not torn on me yet and the medium gauge picks dont wear down too quickly.These are ok to have around the house to play with but I would not recommend them for live performance.
