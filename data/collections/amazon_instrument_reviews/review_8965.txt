This pedal has a great range of function (with variable width and depth) along with an independent level control, and tone controls for low and high frequency cutoffs. It also has a dry through output.It can go from low depth high speed shimmers, to high depth, low speed oscillations, to ridiculous warble.The pedal is light weight, very high quality, durable, quite good looking, and all around a good pedal to play around with.Cons: The blue led, like many blue leds, is VERY bright; I usually cover them up with a sticker so I can see the setting on the pedal.It can also be easy to accidentally touch the pedal casing with the positive barrel of when plugging in (this can frighteningly spark). So make sure to plug in the power adapted into the pedal before plugging in the wall.
