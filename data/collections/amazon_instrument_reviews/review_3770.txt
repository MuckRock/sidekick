the sleek design is just great as the product does not hinder your hands and fingers while fretting a chord.  holds down exceptionally well and the release is effortless.  what i really like is that the padded material is very forgiving and holds the strings without any fret buzz and never damages my guitars.  it is also just great to &#34;hang&#34; on the headstock went not in use.
