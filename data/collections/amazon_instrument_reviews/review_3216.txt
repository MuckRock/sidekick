I was buying a pawn shop guitar, when paying they handed me this amp and stated it came with the guitar. I didn't expect to actually use it but what the heck, I could sell it and make a bit of money back. Got home to set up my new pawn shop guitar and plugged into the Frontman 25 just to see if it worked. I was surprised to find out not only did it work, it sounded very good. I own a Deluxe Reverb all tube amp and the little Frontman 25 had the Fender sound. What really was impressive was the reverb, it went from a nice echo to full fledge drippy surf sound. I actually took it to a few small gigs and it did very well, I normally use a Blues Jr for small gigs but the Frontman did a fine job. On some smaller gigs when all I need is a little reverb I just plug straight into the amp and it worked well, plenty of volume and smooth reverb plus it's small and easy on the back. All in all very impressed and have decided to keep it. I would easily pay full retail, it is a nice little amp, might even see if I can squeeze a 12 inch speaker into it!
