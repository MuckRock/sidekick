I needed a phaser, and saw that the Joyo Vintage Phaser was rated well, and super cheap, so I bought it.  I was EXTREMELY impressed with it, and did some further research into their pedals.  This was one of their top-rated pedals, so I figured I'd give it a go.  I have to say that I am fairy impressed!  I get a wide range of tones coming out of this little box - anything from a light fuzz to a vintage-style high gain.  You won't get a modern metal crunch from it, so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere.  If you want a nice distortion to replicate stuff from the 70's and 80's, then this is a great bet.  This pedal is currently plugged in, and I suspect that I'll keep it as part of my rig (unless I happen to get rich and find a nicer, boutique pedal, or get around to modding my other pedals.)As a reference:  I own several Boss distortion/over drive pedals (Japanese DS-1, SD-1, OD-3 and MT-2.)  I The Joyo JF-02 and OD-3 are the two drive pedals that I have hooked up, since they are by far the best sounding and most versatile drive pedals that I currently own.A side-note for the tone-freaks:  The peddle does seem to be a bit muddy.  It's great for jamming out power chords, but not so articulate when you're arpeggiating chords. (Still noticeable when you back off the gain on the pedal but crank the volume on the amp.)
