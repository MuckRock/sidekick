Everywhere I go, anytime I hear 'ukulele', I also hear 'Aquila strings.'  I've tried several different uke strings for both my soprano and my concert ukes, and I've got to say, these are not my favorites.  I think the sound these strings produce are overly bright, a little squeaky and they don't seem to allow for smooth transitions from chord to chord in my opinion.  At least for the two ukes I have, these strings did nothing for their tone.  I much prefer the Martin Clear Flurocarbon strings!
