I did a lot of research and I finally found the right capo.. It is a little bit pricey, but you get what you pay for...It is made from a very good material and I have been using this for years!!..There are some others capo that are less expensive, but most of them are built with plastic and some will hurt your guitar.. This capo is made with stainless steel and you can adjust the tension.. I like this and I highly recommend this capo to any guitar players regardless of their level. Good Luck.
