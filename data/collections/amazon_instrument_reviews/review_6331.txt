This is a great item because it is small, lightweight and portable and it clips on anywhere (guitar, mic stand etc.) At the same time, because it is so lightweight it is prone to breakage if you give it hard use and don't pack it carefully when traveling etc..  The clip that holds the paper to the corrugated plastic clipboard is very strong.  The clip that goes to the mic stand is also strong but if you leave it on the stand for months at a time it will weaken and start to slide if you put more than 1-2 sheets of paper on the clip board. This doesn't happen tho if you remove the clip at the end of the gig, day etc.  For this price it's a good buy in my opinion and with a little care, you will get more than your money's worth out of it.
