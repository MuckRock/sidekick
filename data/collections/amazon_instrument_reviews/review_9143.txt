This is another great product by D'Addario - I have used several tuners like the regular Snark (several versions), the Snark S1 Mini Clip (also known as 'Son of a Snark'), the Planet Waves Headstock Tuner, the Peterson SC-1 Strobo Tuner, the Korg HTB-1 and the Q7 Chromatic Headstock Tuner. This D'Addario Micro NS Tuner tops all those with ease. It is super easy to use and more precise than all the others (compared using several tuning computer softwares and the Korg Pitchblack floor pedal on my tests). The rotation feature is great and the visual metronome feature comes very handy, like when programming a delay pedal with more precision. The clip that holds the tuner to the guitar is very good, holds very well to your guitar headstock (doesn't matther the brand) and with stay snug there without damaging your guitar's finish. It is very light and you will hardly know it's there once playing - Highly recommended. Cheers!
