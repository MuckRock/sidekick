The FAB overdrive pedal does not work well for me. In fairness to the product, I was aware from reviews that it gives varying results based on guitar and amp. I have a Epiphone Les Paul Special II, with a Fender Frontman 25R amp. No matter how I adjust it, it has a muddy sound. I've heard it used with higher end guitars and amps with very good results. I took a chance based on the low cost, and I do plan to do some upgrades to my guitar. The guitar is new, and has the strings that came with it. I plan to get a better grade immediately, and that may be all I need to get the expected sound. There are several reviews of this product on You Tube. You can do a search there, and hear what it is capable of.
