Thought about buying the (expensive) G7th capo, but I'm very glad I didn't.  The tried and true Shubb works great at a great price.  I don't use it much but it's nice to know that when I do I won't have to mess around with or detune to make it sound right.  The difference between this one and 'clamp on style' is night and day.
