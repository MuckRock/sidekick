What an amazing product. Multi-voltage capability for worldwide use, powering eight pedals, and very cost effective, too. If I bought eight adapters, it would cost me well over $120 USD. Even at the price it's sold at, the build quality is pro level. I'd be happy using this on a well-traveled pedalboard. At this price, you could buy two or three of these packs to power huge boards.I usually run six to seven pedals in a typical session. Not all at once, but it's nice to know that the delivery is smooth, without any drops or spikes in power level. I can crank 'em all if I want to, and go NUTS.
