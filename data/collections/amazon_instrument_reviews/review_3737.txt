every single guitarist that's plays live or even just practices standing up at home has that worry &#34;is my guitar gonna cut lose for my strap and fall down to the floor?&#34; well, there little fellows are a solution, they work just fine, and i think they are reliable. wish they were made it such a way that the securing mechanism were stronger. but i mean, good price, no need to change the guitar's built in strap buttons... 100% recommended... also, i read a review 'bout it not fitting some guy's lp... well obviously, that depends on the strap... but it use these strap locks on my lp standard 1959 vos, and they fit just fine (use it with a gibson asfb-blk strap).
