This polish was recommended in one of Dan Erlewine's books and it works great.  It really makes the natural high gloss finish on acoustic guitars pop.  The effect isn't as noticeable on darker finishes though.  It really helps on the back of the neck too, makes it slippery and fast.  Highly recommended.
