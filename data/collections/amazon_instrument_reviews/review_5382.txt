I own a JamHub Greenroom system for use in a rehearsal space. This cable set colour coordinates perfectly with the JamHub colour coding system!The cables are of a pretty good quality, with solid connectors and well constructed. The cable itself is a bit 'rubbery' and not 'slinky' like some of the higher grade microphone cables, but so far they have held up fine. The cables add no noise or colouration to the signal and the colour coding makes life in the rehearsal space so much easier.
