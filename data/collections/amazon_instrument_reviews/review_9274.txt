This is supposed to be an Fulltone OCD clone, but to me, it sounds a bit better than the OCD, and worse.Has more low end and a smoother mid that the OCD. Thought isnt nearly as dymanic as the OCD, that may not be a good thing though, depending on your taste.If I turn the gain up past 9 o'clock, the pedal sounds more like a fuzz than an overdrive, and kills the dynamics.Thats a good thing and bad, as I like a fuzz tone, but thats not what I bought the pedal for.Overall I can live with it, its well built, sounds good and the price is unbeatable.
