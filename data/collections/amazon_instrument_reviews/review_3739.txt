I'm using this with an Ovation Balladeer. A guitar with a rounded back that demands you use it with a guitar strap at all times. My guitar strap is over 50 years old, circa 1967, so the leather is a bit worn and it had a tendency to slide off the strap holders on the guitar at the most inopportune times.With these strap loks, the strap never comes off. I leave it on when  I put the guitar in the case, and they are there and waiting when I get it back out. I've had it on for 2 and a half months now, with no problems. The hardest part was putting them on, which really wasn't hard at all, just took a moment to understand the mechanics of the mechanism and voila' Bob's your uncle!!Recommend these for anyone who needs to keep their guitar strapped and ready for action. They are plastic and will wear out someday, I'll buy another pair then.
