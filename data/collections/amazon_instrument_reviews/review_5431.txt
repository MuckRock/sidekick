Quite a few people are complaining about the buzz caused/induced by this.  I'm not getting any.  I use an old Arion Stage Tuner, a Digitech Bad Monkey and CM-2 Tube Overdrive, a Dunlap Wah from the 90s, and a Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor.  I run it all into a Fender Deville 410, which additionally runs into an Acoustic B115 Neo bass cab for extra mmmph.At first I thought it was the noise suppressor.  But even when it's off, I'm getting absolutely no buzz from my effects.For the price this is AMAZING.  To be able to have all of my effects powered with one plug is a godsend.  The cables are VERY long, maybe too long, if that's possible.  If you're even thinking about buying this, JUST BUY IT ALREADY!!!!
