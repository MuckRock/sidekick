Others that reviewed this Item I read before purchase, noted it is not &#34;Large&#34; and the picks have to be warmed and shaped to fit your thumb. I also found in original &#34;Large&#34; size, The curve of the pick will cut into your thumb from improper shaping and being too small for the average American man. I am still in the process of shaping all 5, but otherwise they appear sturdy and I haven't broken more than one of similar type in several years. I expect the pick to wear down from use. They appear to be about the same quality as Indigo brand, but not shaped as well for the average player.
