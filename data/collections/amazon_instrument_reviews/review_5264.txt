A very nice pick, both in feel and texture (the design is a bit boring, though). Only complaint is that it's fairly small - about the size of a Canadian or US five cent piece, where most of your typical guitar pick are bigger - about the size of a 25 cent piece. But that's okay. I got this the same time as I got a set of Dava Jazz Grip 9024 red picks and the Dunlop Max Grip Jazz III Carbon Fiber Guitar Picks, and I think I like the Dava picks the best. All three are &#34;tight grip&#34; picks, and all the same size - they're all good, though - I'd rate this one next-best, and the Jazz III Carbon Fiber next after that).
