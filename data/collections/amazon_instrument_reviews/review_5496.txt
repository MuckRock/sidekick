Don't let the price and the fact that they are plastic fool you. This is an awesome pedal. Ive had it for a couple of months now and i would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a metal sound. It is made of a tough plastic and as long as you don't abuse it to much it should be fine. You can adjust all range of sound and make it yours. As the title states I love the sound and I also love the price. Buy this!
