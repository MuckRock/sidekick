For the most part, this is a well built/durable gig bag. I only rated it at 3 stars for the lack of padding. If you need a protective cover for your guitar then this gig bag is for you. If you want something to protect your guitar from bumps and bangs get a more expensive gig bag with more padding or spend the cash on a good hard case. Remember, you get what you pay for and this is a perfect example of that.
