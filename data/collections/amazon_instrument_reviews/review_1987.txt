I didn't know what to expect given the price, but am happy to say this is a very nice guitar for the money. I am impressed by the quality of materials, components, and construction. For example, the tuning machines are substantial and heavily chromed; they work smoothly, and firmly hold the strings in tune. The instrument came relatively well set up right out of the box; the action didn't seem inordinately high, but I couldn't resist taking a little off the bottom of the compensated saddle even so, and now the guitar plays even better. I might tinker some more at some point, probably when it comes time to replace the strings, but for now I am quite happy with the playability and sound of this full-bodied dreadnought, which is rich and resonant and very impressive. I still can hardly believe it is possible to deliver such a fine instrument at such a low price, but the proof is indisputably before me.
