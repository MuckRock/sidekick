I've tried to like this pedal, I really have.  Maybe it's my signal chain (?)  My experience with the DigiTech series is that they suck the tone out from your guitar.  Sure, the OD is there, but it isn't worth losing your tone, is it?  Again, I reiterate maybe it's just me.  I have been messing around with signal chains for almost 3 decades now.  And the blue pedal isn't any different, either IMO.  Grunge was OK, but not my kind of style.
