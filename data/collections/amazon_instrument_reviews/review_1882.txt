I've been buying gear from Alto Music since 1980. I've trusted them with my guitars, and they've helped me make the right decisions for my needs and budget. Last year, I bought a set of Fender Custom Shop Texas Specials directly from Alto's web site. Over the past year, I received a bunch of Amazon gift certificates and wanted to get myself a Shure SM7b. When I saw that I could get the mic from Alto Music, it was a no brainer. I was purchasing from my local music store through Amazon. As for the mic, it's an SM7b, and it's everything I was looking for, despite it being a low output mic. It's smooth, has a sexy low end color, has no harshness, brittleness, or high frequency unpleasantness that can occur with some condensers. I'm recording in an untreated basement, and this mic is perfect for when I'm singing loud rock stuff; it only picks up what's right in front of it and none of the room. I'm using a Focusrite 2i2, which is great for loud singing, but I'm picking up a Cloudlifter for some more clean quiet gain to use this mic on acoustic guitars and softer vocals as well. For me the mic has been all it's cracked up to be.
