I've bought quite a few tuners over the years. These are small, responsive, easy to read, and the fact that they work on vibration means they can be used in a loud setting without interference. These are great!!At first I was turned off by the 'toyish' appearance, but decided to try it after reading the reviews. Let me say that in person they look nicer than in the pics, and they perform way better than I expected.
