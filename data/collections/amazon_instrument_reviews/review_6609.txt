This guitar just got stolen from me!!! Frikkin thieves, I loved this guitar from the moment it was in my hands, it is super light, unlike my other gretsch guitar, so easy to take anywhere, it can handle some rough playing, its simply awesome, specially for what it costs! I am SOOOOO getting another one :D
