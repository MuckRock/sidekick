I purchased this pedal with good expectations. However, my expectations were dashed at the constant popping every time the peadl was engaged. I tried different configurations on my board but the popping remained. Overall the pedal sounded descent for a $30 pedal but I could not handle the frustration. I traded and another joyo for a Ibanez stereo chorus.
