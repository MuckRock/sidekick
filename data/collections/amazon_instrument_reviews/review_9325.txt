I liked this tuner, the look, the size, the ease of use, the quality performance, until it died. I think what happened is I just left it on too long. My problem was that in order to turn the power off you have to hold the power button rather than simply pressing and releasing it. Since it died that first time, it doesn't seem to perform the same. I also haven't really paid much attention to it since it died because I sent another similar tuner in for replacement, and I got an acoustic guitar that has an on-board tuner and a tuner pedal for electric guitar.I wouldn't recommend against this product. Just remember to hold the power button to turn it off.
