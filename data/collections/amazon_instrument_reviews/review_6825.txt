Guitar picks. What can I say? I bought these along with my first guitar, so its not like I have a preference. But they come in a pack of 10 so there are plenty of spares when you lose them, and you will. Definitely good enough to start with until you gain enough experience to know the difference between all the many kinds of picks.
