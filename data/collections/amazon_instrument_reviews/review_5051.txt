I like the sound of this amp. As has been said in other reviews if you want clean sound it isn't the loudest in the world, but is loud enough for practice. If you want a little distortion, turn the gain up and you can have plenty of volume. I'm using it with a cheapo guitar from the sixties, (a Decca), and I believe it produces the best sound I have ever gotten out of it.
