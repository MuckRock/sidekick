This delay pedal was so cheap that I could not pass it up.  and let me tell you, it is easy and fun to use!  I stopped messign with the reverb in my amp and now only use this for a much nice sounds from my guitar.  I actually bought it to try some experiments with my harmonica, but those were dismal failures.  Big win for the guitar though!
