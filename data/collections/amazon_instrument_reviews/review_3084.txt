This is a good pedal overall, rare to see a stereo pedal at this price so I took the chance and I'm pleased. As some have said, the low range has quite a steep slope to it, uncomfortable foot angle. But it's a big pedal, and the pivot seems to be at just the right spot so I can go to lower ranges with my toes because the action is smooth. I wish the TS jacks were top/bottom instead of side by side, seems it would take 1/4 right angle connectors better. One gets in the way of the other. Or even better if it were a TRS jack so you'd only need one input. I might modify it for that.
