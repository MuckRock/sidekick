I bought this for an accousic guitar, then I had to have one for a mandolin, and now I also have one for a square-neck dobro.  Some accoustic guitar manufacturers cases that come with the guitar don't leave much room for a leather strap.  Some case manufacturers have the same problem.  This item fixes the problem of taking the strap off and saves you all the work to untie it, that means a lot when you also have to set up and tear down equipment on a dance job.  Same with the mandolin, if you want a wider strap. The dobro had the issue with the strap didn't have a great connector.
