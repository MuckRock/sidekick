When my case arrived I feared it was too small to hold my Epiphone Dot. But, this case fits my Dot like a glove. The case is sturdy enough to protect my guitar from knocks and dings while the plush inside pampers the guitar's finish. The accessory compartment is large enough to hold my picks, tuner, and extra strings.
