Elderly pickers like me fumble conventional picks onto the floor, particularly when the skin is dry during winter. The grip material molded onto these picks goes a long way toward preventing that. The material used for the core gives a slightly softer tone than the Fender mediums I have used for 50 years. I like the graduated feel these picks have, with a slight give in the center, allowing the player to vary the pick attack between strumming and picking single notes.
