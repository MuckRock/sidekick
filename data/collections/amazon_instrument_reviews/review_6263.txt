Needed a stand to lift my PA mixer off the floor for safety and ease of use. For $20, this is a sturdy little unit and collapses nicely for transportation. But it is a definite tipping risk if used at anything higher than the lowest height setting.I took the lead from reviewer W. Jones and "removed the upper brackets and inserted them with the longest bars horizontal instead of vertical, and although my amp was more stable, I still didn't feel it was stable enough to set it on the highest setting." I am using at the lowest height and it is stable, but I highly recommend a heavy sandbag on the back if any other height setting is used.I give four stars for great value at $20, will suit my needs very well.
