It works ok if you are used to using  a volume pedal. I had a hard time making small volume changes while singing. I decided to return it. It is well made, so if you like volume pedals, it's probably one of the best. I have also owned the Moreley Lil Alligator volume pedal. It has a mimimum volume knob which allows more subtle changes between rhythm and lead volumes. The Dunlop does not have that feature.
