I was in a local music store the other day and noticed a huge stack of these cymbals, with a few examples mounted on stands to try. While they're not as rich as Zildjians or Paistes or other more expensive cymbals, they do have that trashy sound that you look for in a China. And at the asking price, who can resist?
