Ok, this is great for many reasons as most review will tell you and I have had no problems.  Cons: Minor one would be, that when mounted, the face of the tuner doesn't exactly face your eyes, you have to move your guitar a bit to aim it towards you. But the biggest CON is.... it's pretty much worthless at  a bright daylight gig. In sunlight, its TOO dim! ha ha!  At home or at a night gig its fine. Daylight? Forget it.
