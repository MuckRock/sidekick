I've just got the Shure SM58 microphone.As expected, this is a real workhorse of microphones; the sound is clear, crispy, robust, high quality product.Also, I've bought it at Amazon and they sold through J&R; Music and Computer World which is an excellent supplier. They shipped in less time than expected.I'm a really happy customer now.
