My new guitar had only the back strap connector.You can put out over $20 for a button strap holder but for under 5 bucks I decided on this.Attach short end to strap feed long end under strings on guitar head.You now have a quick release strap holder.Very well made & strong!!Happy I found this before spending way more than I needed to!!Highly recommend this product!!Joe
