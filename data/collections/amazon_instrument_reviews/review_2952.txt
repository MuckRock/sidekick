The most annoying thing about modern ideas in Ukulele strings, or indeed in Guitar strings, is to wind them with aluminum wire - making at the least a black deposit of aluminum on my hands, or at worst, cognitive damage skin contact with them. These rather inexpensive strings are not aluminum wound, but are silver plate wound - no health problems possible from strings makes them the best.
