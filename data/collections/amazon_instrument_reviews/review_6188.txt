Up date from February 08 2011 Wow look at all of Them that did Not find My review helpful I should have up dated much sooner,Not that I care because I tell the truth and do good to please Myself Not a bunch of fools. The first time I turned It on It was exactly the Sound I was looking for Shimmer and Space verb.Okay I Am apologizing for ordering the last one I guess I take the easiest way of ordering but If It makes You feel better It put Me farther In financial problems but If You look on some search there are some still left. Behringer needs to look at what The Customers Is buying and make more of them. If Your buying this Reverb Machine then You must be wanting It for Its Ducking also called Shimmer and Space verb If Not then there are cheaper Reverbs as Danelectro as FAB Echo which Is a nice Sounding older type slap reverbs Sound and there Is the more expensive Line 6 Verbzilla, and Someone wrote Me and said Boss has or did have this effect there are Internet videos showing this effect. My Digitech GSP 2101 quit working right It has Ducking Shimmer which Digitech calls String Swell which Is a Violin type Sound and They call Space verb Giga verb and I made the mistake of buying the Behringer Slow Motion 200 thinking String or Volume Swell was Shimmer then If found what I was looking for on Internet video I hope. I had already Wrote some Songs using My Digitech GSP 2101 and started having dreams about having this Sound effect again and just had to have It.How well this Behringer RV600 performs and Sounds I have Not received It yet to know but If possible I will do an up date but I have a Behringer EP2500 Power Amplifier that still works good which I even used as part of a Rife, Doug coil machine but the EP4000 would be better for that use Also the fan runs all the time.
