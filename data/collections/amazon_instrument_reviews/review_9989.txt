I still had the original strings on an Epiphone LP-100 guitar I bought last November. I know that's bad, but buying strings can be complicated (and overwhelming). It was nice to get these through Vine and try them out.There is a definite difference in the sound of the guitar now that the new strings are on. It sounds cleaner and brighter.I wish I'd changed the strings when I first started learning to play because these are much easier to play. Now it's not much of an issue, but it would have made a difference when I was breaking in my fingers those many months ago.I would definitely buy these again, especially because they are so inexpensive.
