Elixir is my favorite brand of strings. I bought these seeking strings with longer life (after a bad experience w/  D'Addario strings only lasted a week or 2) and boy i'll tell you these babies LAST! i only change these strings twice a year & the coating makes it more comfortable & easier to slide on the strings. I love the bright sound you get and they are easy to tune & they also keep in tune good & overall these string are a must try for EVERY guitarist
