This is simply one of the best pedal boards out there. It is very well made, resistant, tough and very flexible as you can adapt a wide variety of power suplies and keep your pedals in great shape. Looks good too. I would recommend to get a few roles of power-grip pedalboard velcro as it definetely holds your pedals much better than the 'industrial' velcro included, especially if you have a combination of both regular size (MXR or Boss) and bigger pedals like a Cry Baby or a VOX Satchurator or Time-Machine Reverb. If thinking of purchasing one of these, you would probably have a few thousand dollares invested in pedals, so this would be great for you to keep them protected and organized. Now, if you are on the road for long, I would suggest to get the hard case instead of the soft case. For eventual gigging the soft case is more than ok.
