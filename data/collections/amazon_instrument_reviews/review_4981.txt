I picked this simple interface up back in 2007 and I can attest that it still works flawlessly after all these years! It's been gigged, dropped, and even rained on, however it still sounds great and functions perfectly. I was using this as my laptop interface and when combined with the free ASIO4All driver, I was able to get anywhere between 5ms and 10ms latency. Under Windows 7, it was plug and play with the default WDM driver, however to really take advantage of capabilities, you'll want to install ASIO4All, especially if you're using Ableton, FL Studio, energyXT, etc. All and all, the UCA202 is pretty limited, however it does allow you to easily get audio into and out of your PC. For the functionality alone, it's definitely worth asking price!
