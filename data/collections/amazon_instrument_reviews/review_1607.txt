Wasn't expecting much for this price. But I was surprised. Have been using mine now for about 3 months with no problems. Workmanship seems good. Does a good job not great of putting equal pressure on the strings but overall it has been a good product. I also have a more expensive Capo just like this one. They look as though they come from the same factory. More expensive is not always better.
