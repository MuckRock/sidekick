I have learned out of experience that when you first pick up guitar, it is a bad idea to practice on a cheap instrument. Cheap $50-100 instruments do not play accurately, and you would be more likely give up. This, on the other hand, is NOT a low-quality instrument. Takamine makes many excellent instruments, this included. It plays very loud and clear, zero buzzing. If you are looking for a practice guitar for either yourself or someone else, look no further. I can guarantee that you will not find a guitar this magnificent for such an affordable price. Note: the package does not include a gig back or case, So I bought this one here, that fits the guitar perfectly:Musician's Gear Deluxe Dreadnought Case Black (Black)
