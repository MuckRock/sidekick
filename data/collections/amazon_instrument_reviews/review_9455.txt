Like many others floor space is rather limited at mi casa. I also have a dog with a nasty habit of having to &#34;mark&#34; everything that comes into contact with the floor. So needless to say your basic guitar stand was not an option with my $700 Dean from Hell. I had ordered this product prior to my having gotten the guitar (hoping that they would all arrive at the same time) so I was unaware at how heavy the Dean was. This one looked sturdy enough...and it would be, if it were an acoustic or lightweight/hollowbody electric.But the fact that I had to bend out the pegs just a smidge, so the end knobs won't chew up the neck when trying to access/store the guitar, had me doubting the longterm durability of this product. Don't need to come home 6 months from now & find the guitar on the floor with the headstock accross the room. It should hold up long enough for me to order the Hercules. Once I get the Hercules I'll be using this mount for my Rock Band guitar controller.
