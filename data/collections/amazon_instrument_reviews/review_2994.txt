Hands down, in my opinion these are by far the best guitar straps you can get. I have a few of planet waves different designs for these, all on my electrics. I have an acoustic-electric Ibanez but the strap wouldn't fit, however the strap wasn't purchased for the acoustic - I was just trying it on all of my different guitars for reviewers sake.If you're considering buying this, just do it.
