Good little stand to hold your guitars.  They function well and are inexpensive.  The only downsides are that they are a bit light, best to place them near a wall, just in case you bump them. Also, it seems that every one that I have ordered (Here and MF) have had the foam a bit crushed up simply could be the packaging from the manufacturer though. Do not use these (or any other foam for that matter) on Nitro finishes.  Good product at a Great price.
