I generally use D'addario with my acoustic guitar only, but I decided to try it out on the electric and I am very satisfied. It has the same light feel as their acoustic product, but it can make all the sweet tones I want it to when hooked up to an amp. I'm not sure on how long it lasts because I only put them on the guitar a few days ago, but they seem just as perfect as they were when I put them on. I would recommend you try these strings on your guitar because they work for me.
