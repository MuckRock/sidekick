Having played guitar for 45 years, I have tried and used many, many capos. Back "in the day," it was a bar of plastic held in place by a length of elastic. It didn't work very well but it is what was available to me. Later, some technology was applied to the need for a ubiquitously necessary accessory that would hold all six strings firmly in place (and in tune) as it was placed up and down the neck of the guitar WITHOUT doing anything to damage the fret board or finish of the guitar's neck. Many 'good' capos have been made. Until now, perhaps the best options have been G7 which fails in its 'softness' that allows strings to slip, and SCHUBB which, unfortunately, 'snaps' into place in a way that can injure the neck of the instrument.This new NS TRI-ACTION capo from Planet Waves accomplishes both requirements consistently and effectively.Designed by Ned Steinberger (the "NS"), the Tri-Action works on a trigger/spring/lever mechanism that works all the way up and down the neck, fits perfectly on the first attempt, holds all six strings firmly in place and does so in a way that causes no abrupt jolt to the neck of the guitar. Both the G7s and the SCHUBBs are better known, more commonly used and more expensive. This is one of those rare instances where what you get is NOT what you pay for. D'Addario, the famous string maker that produces the Planet Waves line of guitar accessories)has done a remarkable and welcome job on these capos. Any guitar player who has gone from one to the other (capo) over time, searching for the one that really does what it is supposed to do all the time, will find this new capo from Planet Waves a welcome tool in the quest to produce clear tones and great sounds on a six-string guitar.
