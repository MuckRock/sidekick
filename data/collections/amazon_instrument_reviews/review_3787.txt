A friend of mine who is a guitar repair genus (and budding luthier) recommended this capo when I mentioned intonation problems with my guitar...I had always had some issues with it, but it was liveable. The real problem began when I switched to different strings- silk and steels. I  LOVED the tone I was now getting, but the intonation problems were suddenly much worse.What I had not considered, until my friend mentioned it, is that while my new strings provide the tonal warmth I was looking for, they are also easier to "bend out of tune". (Duh, I should have thought about this, it makes perfect sense in retrospect!) The capo I had been using was putting WAY too much pressure on the strings, and  greatly exacerbated the existing issue... one that will ultimately need to be taken in and repaired.So he mentioned this capo, and I immediately chortled. ($50 bucks? That's how much he payed. Yikes!)Then he grabbed his G7 from the car and let me try it. The strings stayed in tune! That's $350 on repair I can pocket for other things, at least for the time being. I was so impressed!I ordered one the next day.I am sure I will miss not being able to stick it on the usual perch when I am playing live, but it is really easy to use in general, and I won't look back. The intonation issues are greatly reduced, and I am thrilled.Worth every penny.
