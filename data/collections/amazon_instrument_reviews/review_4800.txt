Needed a mixer and figured it was worth the risk to try this inexpensive mixer.  It is limited in what it can do but it does the job.  I'm rapidly becoming a behringer fan.  The three points mentioned in another rating (Inputs should be out the back, needs rubber feet, and the led) are spot on.  I'd also like to see another set of outputs on it as well.  It could also use being a tad bigger, they jammed everything into such a small area the knobs are a little close together.  The LED for the power on this thing is so bright it's obnoxious, it almost blinds you.  Other than that its a great and affordable little mixer that does everything they advertise...
