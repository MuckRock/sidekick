I liked the string spacing on these nuts. You ~could~ just drop it in and play but you will soon realize it will need some refinement. My open B and E strings, with somewhat aggressive picking, would buzz like a sitar. This was corrected by filing the slots with a back angle towards the tuners. Some additional filing will be needed to remove the sharp edges. The base of this bone nut does NOT have a radius. So if your nut slot is radiused, you will need to have it done or you will have poor sustain and possibly crack the nut in half at string tension. This is more common in vintage guitars, though.My guitar's sustain was definitely improved with this nut. I highly recommend it!
