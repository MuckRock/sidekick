I also own Bose Quiet Comfort 15's and AE2's, and the Grado S80i's. these have become my favorites. The Grado's have tight but somewhat weak bass, and amazing (but sometimes too shrill), and airy mids and high's with a great soundstage; both Bose's have more pronounced bass than the Grado's, and good mids and highs, but less airy and soundstage than the Grado's, and the audio-technica's are in between, with the best balance between accurate and pronounced (but not excessively) bass, excellent mids and highs, and very good soundstage. They have become my favorite phones. Though the bass is pronounced, it is with an accurate depth, and a THUD like a top-line subwoofer, when the bass drum hits. All in all quite a listening experience.
