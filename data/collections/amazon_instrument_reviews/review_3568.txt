This stand works fine if you don't need a shock mount.  The base is wide and heavy enough to secure the mic well and defeat most vibrations.  I ran into trouble when trying to mount a R0DE NT2-A mic on a shock mount.  The low height (4 1/2") - which would otherwise help stabilize the mic - left too little clearance between the mic and desktop.  If you think you might upgrade and someday use this stand with a shock mounted mic, you're better off buying the slightly more expensiveOn Stage DS7200B Adjustable Desk Microphone Stand, Black.BTW, my copy of this stand also did not have the 3/8 inch male thread.
