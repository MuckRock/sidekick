I had purchased this cord and a 25' cord for an assignment I was going on. I had previously  bought a shorter cord that just didn't fit tight enough into the mic.  This one and the other one I bought were really a great, well made product and fit the mics tight and as they should.  I would recommend these cords and will look to purchase other lengths soon
