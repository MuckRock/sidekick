I now have these tuners on an American Strat and an American Tele.  They seem a lot smoother than the stock Fender tuners, which honestly, I have no problem with.  These were purchased on a whim.  I don't find changing strings that big of a bother.  These will save you a few minutes.  I guess if you're a gigging musician, they would be of more value for quick string changes to an onstage guitar.  Don't get me wrong.  If you want a set of locking tuners for your American or Mexican Fender guitar, these are excellent.  But I'm not sure that most people would derive enough benefit out of them to warrant replacing a good functioning set of regular tuners.  I like them, I don't love them.
