I once bought a guitar case that came with a variety pack (from light to heavy) of Planet Waves picks. Since then, I've used nothing else.I've found that the light picks, (.50mm) are perfect for me. These obviously don't last as long as thicker picks, (but still last a very long time), and they suit my playing style and the type of music I play better. The picks are comfortable to hold and are attractively designed in a faux mother-of-pearl style. I'll definitely continue to buy this brand in the future.
