This strap is really beautiful. The Native American pattern goes beautifully with the classical guitar I made with the images of wolves burned into the top. However, the leather ends are very thick and stiff, making it very hard to slip over the strap buttons on the guitar. I tried to put the snap-on strap buttons but had to really work the holes on the strap with an Exacto knife to get the strap to slip over them. I have a nice Ralph Marlin strap with soft, pliable leather on the ends and the slip on and off the strap buttons with little effort - workable with one hand. I'd give this Levy's strap 5 stars if its ends were as flexible.
