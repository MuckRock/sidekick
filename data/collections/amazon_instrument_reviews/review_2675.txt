This is a great-sounding reverb pedal. Tons of options and ways to manipulate your sound. I've combined this with a Epiphone Sheraton II (semi-hollow body) and have been able to get some awesome deep, rich sounds (watch out for feedback though). The design is very solid, and the controls are quite easy to use. Honestly, I think it has a lot of reverb settings that I won't use very much, but there's no problem with them being there.I definitely recommend this reverb pedal for fans of Kings of Leon, U2, etc. Or if you're just looking for a pedal to boost your sustain and create deeper tones, this is it. This has definitely enhanced my creativity with a guitar. My only caveat to this review is that I haven't tried out other reverb pedals, but this one definitely suits all my needs.
