MXR make pretty good Pedals for the money. I thought that this would be a high output, saturated type distortion. It is not. It has plent of Volume, which is good for boosting. But, even with the Gain Knob turned all the way up, this thing is an Overdrive. Which is not a bad thing, if that's what you are looking for. Very Mid-Rangey sound as well. Just not for me. But it's well built and would make a decent OD. But, overall, a pretty Vanilla flavored Dirt Pedal.
