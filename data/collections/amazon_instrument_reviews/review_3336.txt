I'll re rate this item if my problem is fixed but maybe this is normal??  I have a Vox ac30hw2x and I put this jj 12ax7 into v1.  I have a significant volume/gain reduction now.  I know it's the tube because I can put the stock ruby back into v1 and the volume/gain is back.  I haven't checked yet but I'd say there is a 40-50% loss in volume.  I was thinking maybe this is a higher headroom tube?? It's not stamped to be one so that's why I'm confused.  Is it typical of JJ to have more headroom? I'm not digging this tube so far so back in goes the Ruby.
