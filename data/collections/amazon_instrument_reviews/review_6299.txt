I was a bit hesitant to buy a guitar stand for only 10 bucks but glad I did.This stand is VERY sturdy, well made & durable.Foam padded everywhere guitar touches!! Can be folded for easy transport!! Rubber strap on neck rest ensures guitar will stay put if bumped hard!!Pleasently surprised at the quality of this stand!!Highly recommended, very happy with purchase!!Joe
