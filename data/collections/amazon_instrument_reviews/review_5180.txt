Podcasting on a bit of a budget ($200 setup), I wanted good sound quality, nice warm tones .... these mics deliver in a world where I didn't quite have the cash for condensers I wanted.  I needed four mics and this was the best cheap option and my word, these sound great.  3 for under $40 was fantastic.  I am glad I didn't break budget here.  I'm using these with the Behringer 1202FX mixer.  I am so extremely happy with them.
