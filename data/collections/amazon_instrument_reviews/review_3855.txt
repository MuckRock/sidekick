I had no problems at all getting a brand new poly pro strap on these. Even if it was too snug, it wouldn't have been hard to work a strap on to these. I don't know why people are saying bad things about this product, If your dealing with guitars there much harder things to do with guitars than getting a snug leather strap onto the locks. Don't listen to the whiners. These are what they need to be.
