No Doubt.... It's not a really exceptional guitar but for the money you get more than you should. First impression of the guitar was terrible. I took it out of the box and started to play. The neck had a huge bow in it. The truss rod was completely loose. I had to adjust the truss rod to make the guitar playable. I'm not sure if it was just my guitar that wasn't set up or if that's the way they come. If they come with a loose truss rod then this guitar is not for a beginning player as properly adjusting the neck is best left to someone who knows what they are going. Once the neck was setup and the guitar tuned I was pleasantly surprised. The guitar sounded pretty good. The neck is thin and has the familiar feel of an electric. Action was good. Upper fret access is really good. The guitar stays in tune while playing. Plugged into an amp playing through the pickup offered no surprises. The bright red red stained finish on the top was a nice touch. I expected red paint. I would have preferred bigger frets for bending and ease of fretting. They are a little small. $175 for a roundback is really a no brainer. If your a beginner or have some playing experience you will enjoy this guitar and the value it offers.
