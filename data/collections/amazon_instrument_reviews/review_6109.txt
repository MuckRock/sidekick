The main reason I bought this tuner and not similar offerings from boss or tc electronics, is because I had read prior to making the purchase that this is the most accurate at low tunings, and me being a bass player and sometimes playing drop A that is a must. I have to say that after owning it for a while I must agree. I've used other tuners when I happened to not bring this one along and  thats been my experience. Also its easy to read which note you're on when you're on a dimly lit stage.
