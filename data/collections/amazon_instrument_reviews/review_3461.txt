For the price they are awesome strings.... I like the sound(I like a little heavier sound), and I'm hoping the high E will hold up a little longer than the lower gauge &#34;its always the first to go&#34;. You cant beat the price on amazon I paid 9.50 at my music store but I needed strings ASAP, I will order back ups at this price.
