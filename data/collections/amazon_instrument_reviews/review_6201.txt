I bought this under the impression that it was a soprano gig bag. I know it says tenor (now that I look at it) but since I put soprano gig bag into the amazon search I figured I would be getting only soprano bags... Anyway it doesn't seem much more then a normal gig bag. Yes it has the pocket for your extra strings and what not. Not sure how well it holds a tenor since I don't have one. Mine is black not the almost purple the image shows...
