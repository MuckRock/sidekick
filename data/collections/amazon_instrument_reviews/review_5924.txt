Width and padding are good for Heavier guitar (currently being used on a Les Paul). Finish, stitching, and adjustments are quality.The only issue I had was needing super human strength to push onto the strap pegs.You might want to unscrew and screw pegs back on with the strap in place...But that means the guitar is very secure, so I am very happy.
