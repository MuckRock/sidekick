This will work with my daughter's iPod Touch generation 4.  However, the "Garage Band" app is for iOS 7, and hers is an iOS 6.1 and will not update to 7.  So, though she can't use Garage Band, there are others that are supposed to work.  She downloaded the Ampkit app and it works great with her iPod and the Apogee Jam.Here is a list of other apps that are supposed to work with the Apogee Jam:AmpkitAmpliTube (version 2.5 or greater)Amps & CabsAnytuneApple GarageBandAudio Deck ProfessionalBias iProRecorderEveryDay LooperFairlight SamplerFantastocrats StudioMiniGibson's L&M;Hindenburg Field RecorderiAnalyzeriMovieiRecorder ProiShred LiveJamUpLoopyMcDSP Retro RecorderMultitrack DAWNano Studio (TRG-16 pad sampling)PocketAmpPocketGKReap DFXRiot FXRock Prodigy: GuitarScratchTonesSonoma FourTrackSonoma GuitarToneStudio Devil Guitar AmpTaylor EQVocaLive (version 1.5 or greater)Voice MemosXewton Music Studio 2.0It's a pretty cool idea, but the cords are a nuisance.  Most electric guitar players like to stand while playing, and the cords need some managing to keep them out of the way and not have them pull out of their connections.  I was surprised at how small the JAM is.....slightly bigger than a Bic cigarette lighter.  Using this is much more convenient than lugging an amp around, and it saves on other's ears and nerves if they can only hear the acoustic playing of the guitar strings, especially if you are beginner guitarist!Overall pretty good, and very simple to operate.  Just make sure you have a full charge on the device of your choice.  My daughter also used it to record her playing and said that was easy to do.
