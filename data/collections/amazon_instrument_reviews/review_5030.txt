These are great lights for music stands.  If you need a good blackout light theMighty Bright 52010 Pedalboard Light, Blackhas a red light that works great for dark stages.  Because they are LED the batteries last a long time. Some of the Mighty Bright lights also have an AC adapter option but this one doesn't.
