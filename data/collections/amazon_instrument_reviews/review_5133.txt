Not much to say about a basic bag.  It fits a dreadnaught acoustic 6 string guitar, has good padding, and has a large front pouch for music and small (fairly flat) items like a tuner, winder or spare strings.  Has a carry handle/strap, but no shoulder straps on the back as some others have.  Seems well made.
