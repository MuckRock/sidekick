SUMMARYAt $20 it is a great size and "ok" quality to round up a bunch of various stands you may carry to a band practice or gig. Other options are available slightly longer and also with a 2nd compartment inside. No padding or impact resistance is provided, but gets a bunch of stands in one bag with a handle. Also available 8" longer or with 2 chambered configuration on different models.PROS:- Good size for speaker stands, mic stands, guitar stands, music stands other than the top shelf, and other "what-not" you may want to cram in there, depending on your style.- affordable at $20- availalbe on prime shippingCONS:- This model is one compartment. For speaker stands, you may want a 2 compartment model.- Lack of any impact resistance - the bag has no padding at all. it is just canvas.- It would be great if they made one of these just a little wider to be able to accomodate music stands.DETAILSIn one of my 50" bags, I was able to put:- 4 folding mic stands- 1 music stand, other than the top piece with the shelf (that does not fit, even if the bag was empty.)- 2 folding guitar stands- and still had room for some more if I wanted to put more in.- bag was getting kind of heavy at that point.In a sconed 50", I was able to put:- On Stage Stands OSS SS7761B Speaker Stands- They fit with extra room on the ends in this 50" bag.- There is additional room to add mic or guitar or music stands- I am considering exchanging this one for a 2 section 50" bag so the speaker stands are separated, but probably will just keep this one.The bag has no padding at all - it is just canvas and a zipper and handles. When laying empty it is 50" long x about 12" wide and lays flat. Seems strong enough to round everything up and tote it around,But for $20, serves a basic purpose with affordability.
