Bought this in early March this year & have it in-line with my other effects pedals on my pedal board. No problems with it at all. It works as advertised. I've found it to be better quality than the on board tuner that comes in my Fender G-Dec amp so what does that tell you?Not sure what the other low ratings for this pedal are all about because I love mine. For the money you can't get one that touches it. So what if it's not $100+? That means you have more green stuff to buy other things.Since buying this one & having it work so well, I now own a couple of other Behringer pedals.
