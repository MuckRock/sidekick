I have used a variety of these types of adapters in the past, and these are an excellent newer version.  In this case I bought just one quick release to use for mounting a kick drum microphone that has the stand adapter permanently attached to the microphone.  With this quick release installed on the stand and the microphone, the kick drum microphone now mounts to the stand in mere seconds and stays in place very well.I don't quite know why the locking ring is silver on an adapter that is black everywhere else, but at least the ring is good quality and the threads are clean and precise.
