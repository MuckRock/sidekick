In an attempt to see what's new in the pick industry, I decided to dive in and give these a go.  They are way too flimsy if, like me, you use a heavier pick.  I have always used Dunlop Tortex greens and these Davas just can't compete.  Not only were they too flimsy, but when I played with any aggression (heavy rock-based material), the picks would fly out of my hands.  This was a huge disappointment.
