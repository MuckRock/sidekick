I bought these as a solution to obtain feedback while recording my guitar through my computer. That solution was successful. These speakers put out enough power that I can maintain the clarity of my guitar tone fairly well and achieve feedback almost as easily as i do with my amp. I have a 75Watt amp that powers a 12" celestion speaker. These monitors have 70Watts powering a 5" Woofer and a 1" Tweeter, 40W/30W respectively. Slight drop in the power output, but they are beefy enough that I don't really notice.The isolation pads they come with are paper thin, almost pointless. If you really need some, get some more substantial pads. The back panels do get kind of hot after a few hours... not really concerned about that, but it's worth mentioning.They have great sound, excellent low end, lots of clarity throughout. They are pricey, but if you are priced pretty reasonably here on amazon. I would really recommend not going to a retailer... even when they are on sale they are more expensive in store than online. Only go to a store just to hear them and compare them with other monitors.
