These D'Addario  strings are great!  I am currently using them on my Epiphone Sheraton and compared to the Fender Bullets I had been using, these stay more uniform in tone throughout their life.  Intonation is good and I've noticed less breakage as well.These strings are a bit bright but have plenty of 'good' sparkle too and really sound good on my Strat, even more so than my Sheraton.  Being from the 'old school' I still much prefer strings to be packaged individually in paper, but what can ya do? Besides that, I am totally stoked and happy with these.  I think I might try 9's on the Sheraton but even as is they play (and sound) very good.
