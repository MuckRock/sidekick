This little box will give it to you. I personally play bass and I have a thing for long effect chains. I count in my little arsenal with fuzz, distorions, auto wah, a compressor, octaver, bass booster and a nice DI Box. The MXR EQ helps me a great deal to "recuperate" definition and clarity after this long effect chains that I love. A great little box.So if you are looking for clarity, definition and even a little extra punch for your sound the MXR EQ will do the trick.Cheers!!!
