I can't believe I'm giving a 5 star review to a Behringer product, but they got these right... I replaced a way-more expensive Audix condenser mic with these, and they actually sound pretty darned good. If I crunch one or if one breaks, I'll just get more at this price. I have other Behringer mics laying around, and they all kinda suck. These are totally fine.
