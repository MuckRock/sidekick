I ordered two PDMIC58's and they came with an XLR to 1/4 cable included. However, the quality of these cables are mediocre at best, I recommend purchasing a higher quality cable with your order.Now to the performance. This mic is built like a tank, yes, as others have said. It is somewhat heavy but not too heavy, in other words, it doesn't feel like a "cheap".As for the sound quality, I would have to say 3 out of 5 because the mic doesn't sound as clear as I would like it to be. Now I'm not a professional, but this is just my opinion. I'm not saying it sounds muddy, but it sounds tinny, you'll have to see for yourself.Other reviews have also said that this is a great back-up mic or karaoke mic, I agree. However, if you are looking to record professional sounding tracks, you won't find it at this price.Value? To me, I think it's definitely a mic worth having, even if it's just laying around, at this price, you can't beat it. It's a great mic for the price.-Update-After using this microphone for a while, I find it to be somewhat lacking. Don't get my wrong though, for the price, it definitely performs as it should. However, if you are looking to make quality recordings, I would pass on this purchase.
