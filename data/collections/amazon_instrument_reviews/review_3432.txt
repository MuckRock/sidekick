This will make your fretboard smile!  It takes a dry, faded, fretboard and makes it look like new.  A few dabs goes a long way so this 4 ounce bottle should last you a long time.  If your fretboard is really dry & faded, apply heavily and allow it soak in.  Continue applying until the board stops absorbing and then wipe dry.  I was amazed at how this made a dull & faded 40 year old Fender fretboard came back to life.
