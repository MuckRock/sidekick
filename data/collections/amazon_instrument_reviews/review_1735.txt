Simple, compact, well constructed, easy to use, and sounds good; all things you would look for in a capo.This is the original Shubb capo, designed for most acoustic guitars with metal strings. The Shubb website describes the huge range of specific capos they make, each with their own specialized use. The C1 is probably the most universal of all the models. This fits a Les Paul Traditional 08 (Gibson Les Paul Traditional Plus Electric Guitar, Heritage Cherry Sunburst), aPRS SE Custom 22 Guitar, Grey Black with Tremolo Bridge, andEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Collection Electric Guitar, Vintage Sunburstelectrics. The primary use is for a Laguna acoustic.Follow the simple instruction card included with the capo to adjust the tension. It's key to not get too much tension.We've had trouble figuring out where to park this capo. Mostly it goes in a pocket. Once the capo is adjusted to fit the neck, it doesn't clamp tight on the headstock. Not a huge deal, but a consideration.
