Bought this distortion pedal for our son...who plays his electric guitar daily. He loves the functionality of it as well as the ease of use. It also produces a nice &#34;distorted&#34; sound quality and tone (I don't know if I would agree, as my generation hails from a different genre of music). But he loves it and I guess that's all that matters!
