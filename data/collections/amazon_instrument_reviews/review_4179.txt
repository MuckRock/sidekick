For those of you who are doing jangly pop stuff or real peaky, bitey blues material (think Albert Collins), this will likely add a little, and I mean A LITTLE, extra oomph to your sound. It sounds like it uses a touch of reverb and a dash of the higher end of the mids to make cleans sound more sparkling. But you should also be able to get the same sounds out of a Hughes and Kettner Statesman 40 or 60 watt amp, too, just running it straight.To me, from what I have heard, it adds nothing to those who use a fair amount of distortion in their music. It definitely doesn't add any more fatness. So my overall impression is that what this box provides is the same thing that some people swear they get out of copper bracelets for their arthritis or feeling better with an increased Vitamin E regimen. In other words, this is a matter of what is in your head and how suggestable you are.Most musicians already use EQ and reverb and by careful tweaking of those two things you can obtain what you think you're getting out of this pedal, I think.
