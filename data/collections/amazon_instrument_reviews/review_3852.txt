Against most educated and experienced advice from many blogs I installed one of these in my 1972 Twin Reverb 100 watt. The original speakers are too Hi-Fi sounding for me.They hurt my ears, so clean. This speaker has all the range and a little bonus sizzle to boot, but in a round, full, musical way. Again to those who may like to tread in my ill advised path, these are 50 watt speakers, the Twin Reverb is 100 watts. Right now I have the CR and one original speaker running in my TR. I'll get another CR if this one holds up okay. But I'm in a band that plays small rooms a lot so I dont crank it past 4-5 very often. I'll post an update if this speaker fails. But at least on an initial run, I'm glad I bought it.Rock And Roll Forever!
