this is a must have pedal for any rock player, tight compressed distortion sound , you could play with the EQ to get the sound your looking for, it goes from an overdrive sound to a really heavy distortion, It's build to last forever, the sustain is fantastic and the top boost give you another range of possibility's.the only downside is the battery, get the power adapter , batteries wont last more than 2 or 3 days and you have to unscrew the back to replace it.Overall, I'm really happy with this pedal.
