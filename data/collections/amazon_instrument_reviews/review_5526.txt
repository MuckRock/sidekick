The construction of this set is superb. The ends have heavy duty strain reliefs, and the XLR connectors are well made and perfectly mate with receptacles on the devices being patched.Probably the biggest plus is the cable itself, which appears to be heavy gauge - certainly thicker than my other patch sets - and built to last.In addition, I love the attention to detail in the form of color coding, which makes tracing cables behind the rack a lot easier.I have patch cables from different brands and this set does stand out for its quality when compared to the others. And the price is so close to the more generic ones that I have been using that I am switching over to this brand for my future needs.
