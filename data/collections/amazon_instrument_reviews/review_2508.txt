This is a handy little contraption.  I'm using on one of my cheaper guitars. It wasn't compatible with the other strap I've been using and I had a difficult time getting it to secure to my strap, but it worked well with the strap on my other guitar.I think it's a good idea and practical for being on the stage and switching instruments quickly.
