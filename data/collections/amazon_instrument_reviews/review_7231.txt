This is my first noise reducer. It works and like it says it reduces the noise. it comes with 2 knobs and 1 switch. The switch let you choose if you want it to reduce the noise when is activated or to mute everything when activated. The 2 knobs, 1 of them let you select the range of the noise you want to reduce, the other one how fast you want it to start reducing the noise. I noticed a slight change of the original sound of my distortion, but it could be also because i didn't find the right setup. if the knob of the noise to reduce is on the highest setting, then it reduce also the sound of the all guitar, so you really gotta study this before you can use it properly. overall, for the price i'm happy with it, and it hides the hiss and all the other sounds unwanted.
