I was unsatisfied with the tone from either of my two used solid-state amps, so I ordered a VHT Special Six (supposed to be THE best small tube amp for blues harp), I also ordered a Peavey KB2 (solid state keyboard amp).  Then I ordered this pedal and three others (graphic equalizer; MXR carbon copy delay; T-REX reverb)  I figured that I would find a good tone for both blues and other music from something within this combo.  Well everything is being returned except this pedal.  I found that when I plug this pedal into my old 8 watt Peavey Rage, I get better tone and volume than either of the two new amps using them alone or with any combination of the four pedals.  More "tube-like" sound than a top-rated tube amp! AND...if I want a cleaner tone, I can dial it back, or bypass it altogether.  My only complaint is that it does not accept a battery.  You must use a 9V transformer, which is not included.  Oh well, my experience with the other pedals was that a battery does not last long anyway. Yes, it is made of plastic, but if you are reasonably careful, that should not be a problem.  UPDATE: I just found that by plugging into BOTH the high and low jacks (at the same time) on the VHT amp, it now produces "the sound".  I will keep the VHT and use it instead of my Peavey Rage with this pedal.  The sound from either set-up is pretty close, but the VHT requires less fooling around with adjustments, and is more resistant to feedback. I still might keep this pedal though, cause it's easily the next best thing to the VHT Special 6 tube amp.
