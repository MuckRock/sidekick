I've owned a lot of cables over the years, and most have been junk.  For the money, there is no better instrument cable out there than the Spectraflex.  I've regularly rolled 100-pound half stacks over them, jumped up and down on them, and tossed them in the back of a truck with all manner of jagged and unholy acoutrements, and they stay clean and work like the first day.Pros:- Proper shielding means this is a quiet, accurate cable- Slick braided covering makes it super easy to untangle- Very flexible- Metal sleeves enable easy repairs should the unthinkable happen- Available in some very cool colors- Lifetime warrantyCons:- None to speak of.Spend a little extra money and get the best value cable on the market today.  A lifetime warranty means you'll have it forever.
