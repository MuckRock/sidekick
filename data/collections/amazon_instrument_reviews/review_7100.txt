just received the cable, it sounds clear, doesn't feel like it is made of the best materials, I just got this cable today so I can't really comment on how durable it is and how long it will last, so far I tend to believe it is a decent cable for the price, I don't use a microphone very often so this cable should last a while. so far it is working well, I would buy another one if I needed it, the price is right,
