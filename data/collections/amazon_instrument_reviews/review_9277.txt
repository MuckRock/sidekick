this is a great pedal I would suggest it to anyone looking to get a pedal that would do overdrive and distortion it is a little more on the gain side and has a fizzy characteristic not to fuzzy however imo. Its fairly responsive too and the eq is opposite of say a tube screamers pronounced mids so rather flat eq. Plenty of volume and is a clone of the fulltone OCD if you want overdrive that doesn't sound like a tube screamer than this is for you. And botique quality at paupers price.true bypass so no tone loss props to joyo. P.s. crunch distortion is also an awesome pedal by joyo which does plexi tones well and is very crunchy.
