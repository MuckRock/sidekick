I cleaned and oiled the fretboard on my straocaster the day after I received the product. The cleaning product worked very nicely but the oil was hard to get out through the applicator. The fretboard turned out nicely though so I decided to give it a 4 instead of a 3. I have to say though that I believe a big bottle of eye glass cleaner to clean the fretboard with and a good furniture polish would work just as well. Since you only use a small amount the kit will last a long time so it isn't a bad buy. Just remember it isn't recommended for a maple fretboard and could damage it. If you want to use this type of product then I recommend this one.
