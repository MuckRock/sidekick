This product has a quiet metronome; in a playing environment, it won't be easy to hear. The tuner works on a mic, and that too will be easily overwhelmed in a social environment.That said, it's lovely to see the strings "true in." Makes even first tune-up easy. This accuracy will greatly help to tune the student's ear, making "by-ear" tuning possible sooner.Pretty nice. Hate the color.  Oh well.
