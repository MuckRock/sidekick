This is a nice small amp.  It delivers nice, pure sound at more than loud enough levels for me.  One thing I like about this amp is that it is very simple, not a bunch of complicated settings to worry about.  Another thing, I think it's the nicest looking amp I have and I have about 10 amps now.  It's about the same size as my little Fender Frontman 15 and sits side-by-side with it in my living room.  I use the Fender for electric and the Behringer for the acoustic for practicing.If you're looking for a no frills amp that doesn't cost a lot or take up much room, this is a good one for you.Makes a great little practice amp.  I am totally happy with this one and see no need to add an additional acoustic amp.Mine looks a lot different than the photo, it's more brown and actually looks better.
