Got this little guy last night to use with my Squier Tele Custom II, hooked it up and played around with it for a while and it really impressed me for the quality of effect you get for nearly pocket change! I also have a Digitech RP-50 that has multiple effects including different types of chorus and this Fab Chorus sounds better than any of the RP-50's chorus settings.  I am so looking forward to laying down some cool tracks using this with the Tele, my Applause acoustic/electric, and my Squier Vintage Modified 70's bass guitar. And like other folks who've bought this product, I'll most likely be getting some of Danelectro's other Fab boxes and the Dan Electrode power supply.
