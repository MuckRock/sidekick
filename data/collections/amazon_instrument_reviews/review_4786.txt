I originally bought this pedal to boost an old amplifier signal and it works suprisingly well. I wanted a boost which didn't color tone and this has worked well for my needs. The price is good, I bought it locally for the same price here.Since I have bought this pedal, I have upgraded the speaker in the old amp and still use this to boost the speaker to use with pedals. The tone is transparent and boosting pedal output is great. I use it with distortion and overdrive with good results.I have found new uses for my pedals which suffer from volume drop by putting this in front of them. All in all, besides for a good EQ pedal, this boost is effective and worth every penny.
