I bought this bag mostly for practice sessions here and there, or across town. It's a decent build quality, but I wouldn't feel comfortable assigning it to gig duty. It's got a fair amount of padding, and a nice storage array, but once again, I personally feel this bag is more suited for a 12 mile trip to practice or lessons.
