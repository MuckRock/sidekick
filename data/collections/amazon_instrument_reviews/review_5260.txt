I already liked the Jazz 3 picks by Dunlop, these made from the Ultex material sound so much better, and the surface of the pick is nice,even with sweaty fingers,they stay put. I do pick scrapes alot and there is no sign of wear on the edges of the pick. Sweet !!!!! These are clear yellow picks I would love to see them in red, that would be brutal!!!!
