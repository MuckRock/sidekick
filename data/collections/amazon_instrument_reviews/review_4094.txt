this is honestly my favorite cymbal out of all 9 cymbals that I possess and use. very brilliant and resonant, definitely sounds like it costs a lot more than the actual price. trust this cymbal once and you won't be disappointed. it lasts a pretty long while too. it's a thin splash so it does tend to break after about 8 months of use er so, but to replace it is dirt cheap so not really a big issue there. all in all I definitely recommend trying this product
