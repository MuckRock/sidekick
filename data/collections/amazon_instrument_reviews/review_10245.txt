I have reviewed these strings before, and frankly, I wasn't all that impressed with the tone the first time around. I think they feel great on the fingertips and they're very playable, especially for a picker, but I just wasn't sold on the tone. To be fair, I only tested them on a few of my dreadnought guitars, and found them lacking. There seemed to be a drop-ff in tone when switching from my usual strings (Martin SPs) to these.So this time, I decided to try them on a much smaller guitar. I have a Yairi Alvarez AY-20, which is a 000 sized guitar, and they sound terrific. I'm no engineer or physicist, so I really can't explain the mechanics of it all, but they definitely sounded much better on a much smaller guitar body, and they produce a very clear, bright tone across the higher range, and hold their own on the low range.I still don't think they're the best thing since sliced bread, and I still think they're a bit overpriced, but I have no complaints about the quality other than the fact that the coating seems to wear off sooner than I would expect. This seems to have no effect on the tone, but for what these cost, you'd think the coating would last a lot longer than two months (I play daily for at least 30 minutes a day).Overall, these are good (but overpriced) strings that definitely work well on certain types of guitars. You'll just have to experiment to see which guitars sound good with them, and which don't. In my experience, large body guitars lose tone, but they sound great on a smaller body.
