Last week I ordered a Guardian Electric Guitar Stand (A-Shape, Black) Price: $10.99 from Amazon based on an average 4-star review.  I read the reviews first and placed the order, for a cheap, collapsible guitar stand for my electric guitars and bass.  When I got the stand and opened it for the first time and tried to put my Fender Jazz bass on it - lol - no way.  Worthless, and it's now holding my son's 3/4 size classical guitar (barely).Undaunted, I ordered this Musician's Gear stand.  Less expensive than the Guardian, it holds my Gibson CS-356 Custom with no problem and I would trust it with any and all of my electric guitars or basses.  The bottom piece that supports the body of the guitar rotates, and that's a little strange (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but with a little care you can put a guitar into it and remove it with little or no attention to placement. For $8, you can't beat it.JM Tepper
