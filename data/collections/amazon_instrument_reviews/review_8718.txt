This is one of the best pedals I have on my board. I originally thought the reverb on my amp was fine enough but was enticed to try this. I was very pleasantly surprised with the lovely quality of the reverb effect, which can be breathtaking. The settings are all quite useful (Church, plate, spring, hall, room, gate etc) and then you can adjust the amount of the effect and the delay. There is also a toneprint setting which is nice, but honestly, the pedal already has some many ways to adjust the sound, the toneprint seems redundant. I leave this pedal on most of the time - along with my Corona chorus and Flashback delay. It is part of &#34;my sound&#34;.
