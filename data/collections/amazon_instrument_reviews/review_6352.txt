I bought this using Prime and am happy with the power supply. I have many different makes of power supplies. In the end, they are all the same. Proof of this lies in the Boss unit I have owned for 20 years.Amazon had the Planet Waves 9v supply for the lowest price, lower than local retailers and if you do not use or need a &#34;1 Spot&#34; this will not let you down. I may order more to use with some of my older pedals not on my board.
