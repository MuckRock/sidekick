This is a really cheap microphone.  I'm usually amazed how good &#34;cheap&#34; mics sound (e.g. the shure pg line is fantastic), but I'm not amazed by this mic.  It sounds like a cheap mic.  It handles high sound pressure ok, but sounds &#34;tinny&#34; and is more prone to feedback than a nicer mic.For the price, however, you should not expect any better.Likes:- Price.  This is essentially a toy.- Stand and cable too!Dislikes:- Sound quality.  Maybe you want a &#34;lo-fi&#34; sound?  You could make it work.Overall, this is a really good bargain for an extra back-up or kids mic.  It is not a horrible mic.  It is usable for applications like speaking.  For hi-fi music recording, however, you'll notice it is a cheap mic.
