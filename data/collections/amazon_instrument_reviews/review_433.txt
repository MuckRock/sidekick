I love BOSS pedals. I owned a DS-1 (Distortion) and a MT-2 (Metal Zone) for years, and loved them both. This one, is a good "meet in the middle" of those two. It's great if you want some really good bluesy distortion, or you can crank the color and get some thick distortion.As always, this pedal is very well constructed and sturdy. I love it.
