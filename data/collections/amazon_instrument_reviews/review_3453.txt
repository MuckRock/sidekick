I normally buy D'Addario Strings here. I buy the .011 or .012 strings.  This is my first time playing Ernie Ball since I first began learning.  When I first started on guitar I put .009 electric Ernie Ball on my acoustic so I could handle the pain and keep learning.  Then I went to D'Addario strings.  I wanted to try these since the under $5 price is good.They sound nice.  They don't sound as crisp as the D'Addario strings. They sound more mellow and not as BOLD.  They are 80/20 and I prefer those to the other strings out there.  I can't say I love them or I hate them.  I will probably stick with D'Addario since I don't find any difference in them.  I bought some other Ernie Ball strings on Amazon that I will try soon. For the price I would buy these strings at least once to test out and see how you feel about them.  I don't think they sound bad and if they do, it did not cost much to test them.  enjoy
