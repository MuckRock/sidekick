I order 2 of these for my electric guitars.  They are cheap enough and have a pretty good adjustment range.  The end tabs are either leather or some kind of stiff "pleather" knock off. They were VERY difficult to get on my guitar pegs (not a bad thing as my old strap popped off with the slightest pressure).  These are not coming off anytime soon.  They are wide enough but do not have any kind of shoulder pad (I play sitting down so no big deal to me- but if you play standing up these won't be the most comfortable straps) All in all they are a decent strap for the price.
