Gorgeous strapped to my son's Martin acoustic guitar. He loves it. It's pretty without distracting from the guitar itself. VERY well made and durable. I've even been able to clean it easily with a soft brush and water. The leather is a bit stiff, but it broke in in no time. This will last a very long time.
