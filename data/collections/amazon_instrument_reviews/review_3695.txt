This is a great low cost stand that accepts both acoustic and electric guitars. The cradle and neck height are both adjustable enabling a variety of guitar sizes to be used.  While it doesn't fold up small like a portable stand, it serves well as a semi-portable stand and is very good as a stationary stand.
