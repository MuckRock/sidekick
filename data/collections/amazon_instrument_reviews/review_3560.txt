The Shure XLR Female to Male 1/4" Adapter is simply another one of those fix it gadgets that a sound mixer has to have in his kit.I've got a bag of them and they work just like they are supposed to.Now this one as pictured is the mono version, which you would use to take a balanced or unbalanced mic down to an unbalanced 1/4" jack. If you need to keep a balanced feed or if you are running stereo or two channel in a single cable, this adapter will not work for you. You'll need the TRS (tip, ring, sleeve) balanced version of this adapter.
