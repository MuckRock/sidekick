This thing is relatively heavy for such a small stand.  Of course one might think that would translate into sturdy, and one would be correct.  Super simple to use.  No buttons, levers, or knobs. Just pop it open.  It doesn't have an actual mechanical locking feature, but the design is such that if you fully open the outside legs they will basically lock in place.  It holds my acoustic securely, and I have no fear that it's going to tip over on its own.  When you're done, just nudge the outer legs to "unlock" them and it's super easy to fold back up.I had a Fender mini acoustic stand, but it didn't fold flat enough to fit nicely in my gig bag so I figured I would try this one.  I am quite happy as it does in fact fold flatter.  HOWEVER..... I can only give it four stars because when folded the three back feet stack up and give it about a 2.75" thickness.  If Hercules could have figured a way to avoid that, this baby would truly fold as flat as a magazine.  It's still pretty flat and takes up less room in my bag, but I think the Marketing guys used a little creative license with that description.  (Either that or they're comparing it to the Cosmo year end recap issue.) Still a great little stand and I would buy it again if needed.
