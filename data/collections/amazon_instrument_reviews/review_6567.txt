I simply love the cradle from Jim Dunlop (although a little pricey).  First, the material that the neck rests in is very soft.  Overall it is bigger than appears and it gives me warm fuzzies to know my guitar won't fall off of that skimpy little 3 legged arrangement sold elsewhere on this Planet.  I did find it to be a little short to support my Ovation Acoustic Bass, but a small length of 2 x 4 fixed that.  Second, it is nice that it just rotates over to support the front of the fretboard while guitar is on its face which I need to get into the back guts side of my Ovation.
