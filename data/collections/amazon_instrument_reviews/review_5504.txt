This OnStage "Heavy Duty Guitar Stand" is exactly what we were looking for to hold my son's acoustic guitar. Here are my observations:+ Easy to Setup; takes just a few seconds+ Sturdy; free standing design works well+ Neck Retainer; adds a degree of protection from accidental knocksThis is a great basic stand that works exactly like we hoped!Highly Recommended!CFH
