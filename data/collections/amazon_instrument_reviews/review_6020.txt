This is working for me quite well and is part of my keyboard stage rig now.I'm mounting it to a heavy duty On Stage brand double X stand. The resulting arrangement is reasonably stable, although if you put a bit of pressure on the mic stand you can rotate the Attachment Bar. I could tighten the handle further to prevent this, but am worried that this will begin to deform the X stand, and it is not a problem on stage. I am not worried that it would damage the Attachment Bar, as it is quite heavy duty.In general, it's strong enough to hold a typical stage mic on a small boom arm.
