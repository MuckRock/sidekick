I almost always play finger style without a pick, but on the occasion I need a pick I like these.Easier to strum sounds good to me.If you're doing a lot of picking out individual strings, you'll probably want something thicker, but these make it really easy to strum chords and sound good, plus pick out a few strings here and there.
