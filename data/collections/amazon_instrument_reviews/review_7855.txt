This is one beefy string winder.  There is really no comparison between this professional tool and those cheesy $2 toy string winders you find 100 to a bin at the accessories counter of your nameless local guitar superstore.Pros:- VERY sturdy- Rotates extremely smoothly- Well balanced- Fits every guitar tuning key I've tried- High-impact plastic body should withstand years (decades?) of abuse- Clandestine compartment in handle was a nice bonus -- for earplugs, extra end pins, whateverCons:- None whatsoever.Buy this immediately and save your wrists for more lucrative pursuits.
