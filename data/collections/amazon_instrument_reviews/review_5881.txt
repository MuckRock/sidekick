I bought this intending to use it on my Seagull acoustic but tonight I put it on my Squier Fat Strat instead. after getting tired of how raw the existing polypropylene strap -which was about the same price just because it had "Fender" embroidered on it- was making my neck.When I put this on the electric the difference was immediately noticable even though my neck was still sore from the cheap strap.  So I decided to sign in and write this review.This strap is softer and better made than the poly ones.It even comes with a string tie for your acoustic, which you might need.Consider taking my advice: Treat yourself.$15 for a strap -when guitars cost hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars- is not much.Besides, the cotton and suede will not scratch your axe...The only downside is that the strap ends are pretty thick and is very snug on my pegs.I use c-type snap-on strap locks but they will no longer fit.Maybe I'll see if the venerable Grolsch strap locks will work.You can spend more to get wider straps with more padding if you want but do not bother getting something cheaper unless a strap of at least this quality is on sale.Update: Too snug for Grolsch strap locks on the Squier also...
