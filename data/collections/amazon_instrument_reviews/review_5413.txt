So I recently purchased the Visual Sound One Spot Combo pack and I must say I am quite pleased. I was checking out some of the higher end products (T-Rex Fuel Tank, Voodoo Lab Pedal Power) and just didn't feel like forking over the money. Maybe one day if I'm going to be playing gigs on the regular and can afford to pay around $200 I'll go for one of the other products, but from what I read on the Visual One power supply I was willing to take a risk (especially for the great price)Currently I'm powering 4 Hardwire pedals, a Dunlop Wah pedal and the Berhinger CS400 (see, I'm cheap sometimes - but effectively so) So I'm already using 6 of the 8 power supply cables. All pedals are powered without issue, without noise, there is no hum or hiss or delay or negative effect WHATSOEVER! I can't say enough how excited I was to see this as a viable option for powering the pedal board I just put together, and when it came through and worked flawlessly, it was all the better. I would highly recommend this product to any beginner guitarist starting to fiddle with effects pedals, or even a moderate or novice player - It's simply a RELIABLE and affordable way to power your pedal board. 2 thumbs up and 5 stars!Rock on
