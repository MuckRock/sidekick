I used to use the Tortex pick until a buddy of mine gave me one of these.  I ended up using that pick for something like 3 years (playing 1-2 times/wk).  Once I started playing 4hrs/wk at my church, I decided that this pick had proven its self so I order a small box.  I have never dropped one of these and have never broken one.  FYI: I generally don't play hard and I always play acoustic, Nanoweb custom lights.
