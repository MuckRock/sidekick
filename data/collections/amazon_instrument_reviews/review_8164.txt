What can I say....for the price, this is the best tuner out there right now!  So nice not having to step on a tuning pedal in order to tune while I'm gigging onstage.  I just cut the volume on my guitar (Snark senses vibrations through the neck...so no sound needed!) and I'm done!Tap tempo works great too if you need to know the tempo of a song!  Just another awesome bonus :)
