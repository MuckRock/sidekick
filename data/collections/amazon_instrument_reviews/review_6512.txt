I had neglected my guitar for awhile but just got back into the swing of things. Needless to say the strings were at least 5 years old and I was about to replace them with new ones but thought I would give this a try. I am amazed at how good the strings feel now. They really are like a new set of strings. Saved me 20 bucks in having it restrung too soon so they already paid for themselves. My only reason for knocking off 1 star is because the darn thing is harder to open then it should be. They could rethink the clasp a bit more but it does get the job done.
