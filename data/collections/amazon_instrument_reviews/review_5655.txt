I've been using Dunlop Tortex picks for years, with the .60 and .73 being my mainstays for acoustic & electric picking.  They feel great, they're easy to hold on to, and they have exactly the amount of give & attack needed for my style of playing.  If I have any complaint, it's that the edges wear down with use, sometimes quite rapidly.  Still, they play so well, it's worth the cost of regular replacement.
