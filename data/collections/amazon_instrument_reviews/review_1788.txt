Piece of plastic with no bracing. Due to design, will not attach to stands that have a turned lip on the shelf (which is most quality stands). I used double-sided sticky tape -- problem solved. Gives me a place to stow my guitar picks, tuner, capo and pencil and as such, is an invaluable accessory. Worth the 6 bucks, just be aware you may have to improvise when it comes to attaching it to your stand!
