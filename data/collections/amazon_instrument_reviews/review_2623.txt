I don't own one, but have been playing my sister-in-law's for the last year when visiting. Didn't know much about the guitar, but was quite impressed by the sound and workmanship. Changed the strings, and, other than the action being a little high, it's as good as anything I've played for under $500. I honestly thought it cost around $350, so I was quite surprised seeing it for sale for less than $100. It's definitely a great value.In part because of my experience with this guitar, I purchased a Takamine G Series 12-string last year, (for considerably more money), and it's simply incredible.
