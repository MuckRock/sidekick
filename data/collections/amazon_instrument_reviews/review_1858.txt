This is a pretty good stand and is relatively robust for its compact size.  Opens easily and folds up to a fairly small footprint for storage/transport, and it cradles the guitar nicely.Two minor issues:1) Personal gripe - the git leans back a bit more than I would like.  Makes it more difficult to hug a wall and ends up taking more 3D space than it really needs.2) Product gripe - the two footer bars are not quite level with each other, so it rocks just a little bit.  However, with a solid body electric on it, even a little rocking can be a really bad thing.I like OnStage and own several of their products.  They are well constructed and a good value so I have no doubt I was just unlucky with this one.  I've been applying a little persuasion to even it out and it's getting better, but with the relatively robust construction it just doesn't want to give much.  Kinda sucks that it's not level out of the box, so 4 stars.
