Wuhan makes great products for the money. I have the 18&#34; medium crash and so I decided to try the 16&#34;, both are great cymbals for the buck. If you close your eyes you would swear you were using a Zylgian from the 60's or 70's. Nice tight crash with some great overtones heard in more expensive cymbals,  With any cymbal it is the way that you play it that makes it sound great, so with a little drum finese you can get a great sound out of it, the 18&#34; is a bit warmer than the 16&#34;, the 16&#34; sounds well smaller and a little less sustain a bit colder than the 18&#34;, bought 4 Wuhans, the 16&#34;,18&#34; 21&#34;(ride) and a 12&#34; splash. Will review each one as they come in from Amazon. Why the 4 stars?....well its not a higher end or classic zylgian but damn close, if your on a budget like I am, go for Wuhans. I have been a producer and multi instrumentalist for years, this is a really good product and excellent 16&#34; crash. Wuhan really impresses me. There are some great video's of Wuhans on You Tube, you should really check those out before buying Wuhans, or any cymbal for that matter. I am very pleased with this 16&#34; crash!
