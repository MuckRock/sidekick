Picks are picks right? Select your material, select your weight, and you're done, right?No! these picks have this difficult to describe pattern molded into them... They &#34;grip&#34; your fingers... It's uncanny... They do not slip.I wouldn't touch anything but Fender mediums for years and years... Tried these on a whim... Not I have piles and piles of picks going unused... These are THAT good!
