I've been playing for more than 30 years. There are a lot of great products out there and I've tried a lot of them. I have to say that the feel and tone of these grey Dunlop Gatorgrip 2mm picks surpasses the Dunlop yellow gels, Fender 351 X-heavies, and Golden Gate or Dawg mandolin picks. This is just my opinion, but I hope you'll check them out because I'm sure you won't be disappointed!
