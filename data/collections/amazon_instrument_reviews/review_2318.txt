This Dunlop "Ergo Pickholder" is so convenient for storing picks directly on the guitar. This is a great way to always have picks handy, especially if you drop one while playing. Here are my observations:+ Small Size; is fairly unobtrusive when mounted to the guitar+ Easy to Attach; just peel of the paper backing and stick it where needed+ Good Capacity; easily holds 6 picksMy only note of caution is that if you overload this and then fumble pulling out a pick, you are likely to get more then one dispensed in your hand. Try it once or twice and it is easy to avoid.RecommendedCFH
