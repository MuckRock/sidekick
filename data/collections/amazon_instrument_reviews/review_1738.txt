Researched around for a highly recommended capo and the result is the Shubb.  This is a capo that while is not easily adjustable to slide up and down like other spring types, it's a great capo and very durable in construction and material.  Like a good guitar that is well cared for, this is something that's great to hand down to the next generation.Please click YES if my review have been helpful to you, it will encourage me to continue writing and updating my reviews, and leave a comment if you have any questions, I will be more than happy to answer if I can be of help.
