This Capo is inexpensive and works well.  Clips on easily and hold strings down nicely.  What more can I say.  Gotta keep it simple on this review because it's a simple item.  Simply, it does what it's supposed to do for a low price.  I think it will last a while too but I'll probable misplace it before it breaks anyway so I have a few of these floating around.  You should have one of these in each gig bag.
