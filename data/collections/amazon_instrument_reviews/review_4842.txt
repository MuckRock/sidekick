Really a remarkable microphone for around $100.  Very sensitive . . . its for studio, not live performances.  Be sure to set your DAW insert on your input channel with a compressor/limiter, as you can easily blow through the volume into clipping.  Has a rich warm tone, like tube mics.  Compares to a Audio Tech 2020, not in the class of say an Audio Tech 4040.  Can't beat it for the price.
