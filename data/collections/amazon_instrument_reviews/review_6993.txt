I doubt you can beat this for $25! The uke is a solid little guy.  I shimmed the bridge a little because I can play hard, but it wasn't bad. Pretty well in tune up the neck.  Strings are ok but I do have some Aquilas to put on; will see if it matters much.The tuners ARE geared, not friction like in the one picture --- at least, mine are.The carrying bag is just that, with no padding or other protection, but keeps the rain off.
