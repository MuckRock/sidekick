If you are a broke performer of harmonica blues and need to get back on track, these will not help much. That being said, these are not junk, nor are they cheap nasty instruments - there are plenty available that are much worse than these. Straight from the case, these don't bend well, but do not despair. Having an experienced player break them in gets one of them behaving well in a couple of days (about eight hours of playing) So far I have persuaded the G A Bb and C to bend enough to satisfy curiosity, but they will not hold up to serious playing. I do not destroy my harps easily, so am not the most aggressive player out there, but I felt like these would certainly be something even I may wear out pretty quickly. For the purpose I intended these to perform they are about perfect - with me breaking them in, I can pass them on to my non harp playing relative for them to learn the basics.  Better use these inexpensive harps to over-blow and squawk through, than the set I will be buying in six months; if the promise of musical ability follows through. The advantage of the plastic comb is that I don't need to pass on any germs with them - they wash very easily, with no damage. For the price, you get seven good harps, that make presentable learner instruments, with just a little prep. Without the experienced blues player to break them in, it will take a bit of patience to learn bending on them - there are many YouTube videos that will teach the method, so try hard, persevere and you will crack it with these harps  - try learning bending on the lower key instruments first; they will be easier.
