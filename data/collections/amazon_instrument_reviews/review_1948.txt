I love this pedal. I bought one used at GC the other day for $30 and never looked back. Before it I was using a Joyo Vintage OD that is also an excellent 808 Clone but this pedal is able to tweak the highs and lows better. I have it set so the level is set to 9:00, Low is set to 1:00, High is set to 9:00 and the Gain is set to next tuesday. I prefer a beefier tone with a little less highs and it does that. It also is a nice smooth OD not too crunchy.For a cheap 808 clone this is the best I have used hands down.Maxon 808 - $150Ibanez TS9 - $100Digitech Bad Monkey - $60Joyo Vintage OD - $50All great pedals for the money but not really sold that the Maxon is 2 1/2 times better.
