I've tried every standard pick - even bone, silver & really expensive ones. These little Dunlop stubby jazz picks are my favorite - and they're cheap! Great on guitar and also *awesome* on mandolin. They are small, which takes getting used to, though.Play with the round side for a fat tone. Play with the pointy end for a little better control with only slightly thinner tone.
