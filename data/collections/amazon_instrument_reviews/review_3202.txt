One of the my favorite thigns about Strats is how easy they are to modify/customize. After about 10 years with my American Standard, I was itching to change up the look so I changed out the pickguard and then wanted to give it a nice vintage look with some aged knobs and pickup covers. I didn't need the back plate but this kit was cheaper than buying all the parts I wanted seperately. The back plate is a single-ply, mint green so if you go for a mint green pickguard and want the aged accessories, this will give you a matching back plate. You can never go wrong with real Fender parts.
