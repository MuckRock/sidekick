I have another cheap clip on tuner from guitarfetish.com which works well.  The Snark is a bit larger (only an issue, really, if you don't like having something clipped to your headstock) but it's much easier to read, and it's very sensitive and accurate (according to my ear, anyway).  Easy to use, picks up the note very quickly, and the colored visual indicators are so easy to see, even in bright light, which can be an issue with my other one.Also, someone made this point in another review - this thing can be a great training tool to learn the notes all over the neck. It picks up the note very quickly, and so it can be used very easily for that purpose, as well.
