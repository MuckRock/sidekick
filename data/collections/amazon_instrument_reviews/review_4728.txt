A little large and not really light, but folds down and the tray folds in a clever way. Fits into the supplied bag with shoulder strap. Very well made, although the bag is a little lower quality. Sturdy enough to hold a big binder, 300 page spiral bound book and not feel at all unstable. Goes up and down and tilts back. No slippage.
