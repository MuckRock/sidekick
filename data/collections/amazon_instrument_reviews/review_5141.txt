If you've seen the youtube videos, then you know what this can do.I especially appreciate that it has the two modes: one for regular sustain and one for a 'feedback' sustain.They can be switched back and forth even while you're sustaining a note.I can't wait to use this with my band - we'll have to cover "With or Without You" for sure now![...]
