I ordered this Capo on a Thursday and received it in the mail the following Tuesday. I had never used a Capo of this design so I was a little skiptical but I figured with the price, I might as well give it a try. This thing works great. There is not a name brand on it but looks really good on my acoustic guitar. The spring on it is very tight and ensure a good quality sound when moving in up and down the fret board. I have only used Kyser Capos in the past but this one works just as well. Only drawback to it is that you have to make sure it clamps down evenly on the fret you are changing keys to, otherwise you'll get some rattling noise from the strings. Once you get the hang of placing it where you need it, it works very fast when you need to change keys.
