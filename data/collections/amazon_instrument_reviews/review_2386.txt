I bought these for spares and also use on other amps so not to have to swap back and forth.I like the right angle plug end for guitar input and fits a std. Telecaster input jack great.The flexibility of the cable itself is another thing liked. These do not tangle in use androll up easily for storage. I have more expensive cables but rather use these.
