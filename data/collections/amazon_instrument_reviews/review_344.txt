I have been using these for months now with 5-string bass. I think these are even more useful for bassists than guitar, as I often find myself playing with fingers, then suddenly a "pick song" starts and... where's a pick? I usually have to offset it, and with the tuner placement I can only fit one pick, but I still find them indispensable. And no tape or other sticky stuff!There is also a model made specially for bass. [Updated] I now have the bass model on all of my basses. It is definitely better for thicker strings.The guitar model is now on my Gibson Explorer. I do love it, but the "spreading strings" on the headstock makes it less secure than is perfect. So, still highly recommended if your headstock has a "straight through" design, not so much if you have a jackson or other radically angled headstock. (They should make a Metal Edition for that. :) )
