The strings gauge is the best thing on this strings set. 0.1, 0.12, 0.16, 0.28, 0.38, 0.48 are the perfect balance between weight  and confort. It fits very well on my guitars: 1) Fender EVH Wolfgang, 2) IBanez S470. The cons is that these do not come with VCI, so expect some flakes when you open the pack.
