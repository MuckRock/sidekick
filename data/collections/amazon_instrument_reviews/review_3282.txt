This is a pack of guitar strings.  It sounds good on my guitar and it's not that expensive.  I like it(4 star rating according to amazon).  I would rate it 5 stars(amazon rating for 5 stars is if you 'love' the product),if it made me sound like Clapton unfortunately, none of the gear that I bought can do this!  Also, I kind of find it hard to 'love' a pack of guitar strings.
