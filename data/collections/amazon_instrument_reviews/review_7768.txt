I am not a big user of flanger and my only comparison is with the flanger that is in the Boss ME 70 multi-effects pedal. This unit sounds good and is adjustable. It appears to give a few db boost whether or not you want it. There is no apparent degradation of signal when not in use. There is no &#34;subtle&#34; setting on the flanger, and so when it is on you know it. I think it is pretty cool and I mostly use it on my Fenders when I looking for heavy rock sound with overdrive..
