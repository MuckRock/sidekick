I wasn't expecting much from this case; I bought it on a deployment to take a guitar back home with me that I had also order off Amazon that was of better quality then I had expected. This case is sweet! I love the black and crome, it looks great and the inside is well cusioned and really smooth. If you need a case don't even think twice about, this is a great one at a great price.
