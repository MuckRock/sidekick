I ordered the telecaster version and received this strat version by mistake BUT I liked this so much I decided to keep this one, reorder the telecaster version so I can have that too.  The body is very solid, beautiful finish (mine is a sunburst color).  For $79.95 this is a must buy. You will not be sorry. I have 3 fender type strats and this one is now my favorite. It's great for recording. I just bought a Zoom G5 and it works great with that.  The tones are rich and warm.  I agree with others that the quality is similar to strats costing $399 and more.  It fits so well in my hands and feels great. I love this guitar!!
