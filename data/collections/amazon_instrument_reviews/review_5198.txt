I have four of these - and will continue to use this product. You'll purchase this system first, then all you need to do is get the replacement packs. For my Taylor Baby, the string spacing was a little small, but there was no problem inserting the pack in my other three guitars. Very easy to use. As a recommendation for keeping your guitar in good condition, I would also buy a humidity meter so you can keep tabs on the room where you store your instruments.
