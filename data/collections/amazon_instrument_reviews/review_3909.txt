This is a fine stand for the price, but I was honestly surprised at how light it is. I honestly think On Stage might have been making these progressively lighter over the years and now offer a heavier duty one at a higher price. I do use this stand, but I wish I would have sprung for the heavier duty version and probably will in the near future. It works fine, just keep in mind it is not the heavy duty all metal construction stand of the past.
