This is just what the doctor ordered. I bought three and am purchasing 3 more. All of these units threaded nicely into all of my stands and microphone holders. If I switch one mic to another stand, it could not be easier, just a press of a little button. With different shock mounts on different mics, I don't have to worry about re-threading the mounts each time I change mic stands. The time it saves is also invaluable. No problem with quality control on the 3 I now have, and I have no complaint with the build. Great for the studio, where I use mine, would think It would be clumsy for a performer who takes a mic on and off a stand, use a clip for that.Addendum:I love these so much, I have bought one for each mic in my locker, and each stand. That's a total of 12. None of them have failed after almost a years worth of use, the best invention for a mic since the shock mount. These will save you time, guaranteed!
