This tuner can be adjusted to be very easy to see when you tune your instrument.It senses the vibrations of the string through the neck and head, so the sounds of other instruments do not effect the tuning.Very light, so I leave it on when I play...and it turns itself off when I forget, so it doesn't unnecessarily drain the batteries.Inexpensive so can afford three, one for a banjo, one for a bass and one for a guitar to keep in each instrument's case.
