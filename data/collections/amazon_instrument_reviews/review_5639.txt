I do own a few Behringer pedals and many are very good sounding for their price range, and this pedal will stay in my collection.I've spent $200+ for a few of my pedals, but I order and try many other pedals within the same effects range, because some I believe are just to costly for what you get, and the sound quality usually are not that far apart.I would put this pedal in that category. This is my 1st compressor pedal and while I dint think I really needed this type of pedal, for the price I thought I would give it a try... WOW! The Behringer DC9 Dynamics Compressor Pedal greatly enhances the sounds of every other pedal on my pedal-board, plus I get a volume control knob that allows me to drop my amp output level to below where to amp is set. So I can go quiet on an apartment at late hours, with a 100 watt amp, that's nice.So I would say the majority of people will absolutely love this pedal.
