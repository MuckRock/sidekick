I am a long-time musician who has been through a lot of capos; some that I hope to never see again :) ... fortunately, things have changed for the better ...What serious guitar players have always needed is a capo that is smart and small, durable, quick change, one hand operation that also has the right tension to make sure there is no string buzz or detuning ... for a while, you could get quick change or tension adjusment, but not both in the same capo ... the last several years have seen manufacturers attempting to provide these key features in one acceptable capo ... now there are many choices out there at various price points and frankly, it gets confusing ...So why this particular capo?  First Planets Waves is a name I have come to trust to provide quality accessories at reasonable prices ... this NS Tri-Action Capo is built sturdy but it is very light and unobtrusive on the guitar neck ... one-hand changing is a cinch and it has a well place adjustable spring tensioner ... so far, this capo covers all the bases in a simple design as well or better than anything else I've tried for the price ...One thing I did not expect is that, because of the design and tensioning, I can use it on Tenor Guitar, Banjo and Mandolin as well ... while I prefer a smaller capo for these other instruments, in a pinch, I can just clip on the NS Tri-Action and keep playing ...I am the kind of guy that when I find something in the instrument world that works, I stick with it for years ... it is possible that this capo may become my favorite ... I just really like the look, feel and features of this smart design ... looks like Planet Waves hit the mark once more ...
