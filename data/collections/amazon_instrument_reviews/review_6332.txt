This doesn't look very robust, I expect it will work well in my home studio but if my kids get with in 6ft of it; consider it broken. The swivle hinge is secure and will hold it's position as well as the clamp but they could not have been made any more marginally weak.The backing board mine came with is about 2/3 the size of a full sheet of paper, make what you will of that... and mine is actually secured to the clamp with dual side adhesive so separating them would be a chore and a risk.Overall, a reasonable value and I'm glad I bought it.
