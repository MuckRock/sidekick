First off this stand is a guitar stand that is cheap and it does what it is supposed to: it holds your guitar.  One thing it has that was a surprise to me was a rubber thing to hold the guitar in at the top which was a bonus.  I use it for my Mitchell Acoustic and it holds it perfectly.About the effects on finish.  After Googling it, calling where I purchased my guitar, and reading the little tag on the stand, the foam on this and many other stands may affect &#34;Nitro Cellulous Laquer Finishes.&#34;  How do you know if you have this finish? Basically the value of your guitar and/or the age.  This finish is used mostly on high end guitars in the thousands of dollar range and some vintage guitars and vintage reproductions. It is not used commonly today except for specialty guitars.  It is a finish that is actually sought out by people who know of it as it is like a hybrid of gloss and satin as the tech at GC told me.
