This is definitely a must have for the home recording enthusiast, especially if you are using any of the XENYX or other Behringer brand mixers (it also works with other mixers as well).This is a great, inexpensive, way to  get your analog audio into your digital recording software. It works on Windows, Mac and Linux (at least it did for me).
