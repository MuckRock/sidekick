These picks sound great, very durable and grip is the best I have used. My main complaint is the very small size,I haven't got enough room to vary my finger position and get different tones out of the pick. I find the Dava master control more to my liking for most things, but I still use the jazz III's from time to time when I just want a simple clean pick tone.
