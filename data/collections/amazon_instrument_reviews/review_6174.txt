This is a warm analog delay with a great deal of range.  Its warm and the modulation sounds great.  This is not a digital delay the echos will not be exactly what you play, but that is why you get an analog delay, so you hear the part just a little to the left.  Get it, it is tank tough and endless hours of fun.
