I bought this to use primarily with my newly bought Ukulele, but it also works perfectly to tune my old acoustic guitar too. The display is large and clear and the reading is extremely accurate. I wish I'd bought one of these years ago instead of tuning my stringed instruments manually "by ear". Until now I'd assumed I tuned my instruments perfectly well, but this unit proved me wrong - both my Uke and guitar sound better after being fine tuned with this.This little gadget saves time, improves tuning accuracy and is absolutely perfect for the job it is designed for.It comes supplied with a CR2032 battery and a basic protective bag to keep it in when not in use.
