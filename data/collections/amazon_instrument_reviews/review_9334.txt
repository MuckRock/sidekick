I bought two for 10 bucks each. They work great on my acoustic and electric guitars. Easy to see, and it centers quickly when tuning, without drifting all over the place. The only thing I would do to improve is add an off button. There is an ON button but the tuner will stay on as long as you are plucking/strumming strings. It will turn itself off in one minute if you stop playing, but I usually start right into playing after tuning. The only reason to turn it off would be to conserve battery life. This is a great little tuner and I am glad I bought it.
