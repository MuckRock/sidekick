Large pedal board plenty of room for all pedals including octaswitch. The included velcro works well for me, I haven't had any pedals fall off yet! Cioks PSU fits underneath with a couple of modifications. I'm careful with my stuff so the soft case suits me fine, I can sling it over my shoulder and carry guitar/amp all at once. Plus it has a large useful pocket on the front of the bag. If you travel a lot the hard case will probably be better though.
