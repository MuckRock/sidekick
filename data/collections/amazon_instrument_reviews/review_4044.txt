Nicely made strong strap with colorful pattern. It fits my ovation quite snuggly, I bought some retainers, but found them unnecessary so far. I couldn't remove this strap if I wanted to, well I could but its just too much work. So it will stay where it belongs for a few years at least.The only thing I don't like about this strap is the edge of the strap is a bit abrasive on my bare neck. Not a problem in the cooler months when I'm prone to sweaters and such, but in the summer it takes a bit of getting used to. It's made of a canvassy cotton, so its strong, but its also a little rough. I'm going to try waxing the edge with canning wax or candle wax and see if that smooths it down a bit.It is a very nice strap and will last years. I like it almost as much as my 40 year old ACE strap, which is much softer due to 40 odd years of use and abuse by a multitude of musicians. But finding an old ACE for anything close to this price is a fools journey.Buy one, then keep your eyes out for a hootenanny. You'll be ready.....
