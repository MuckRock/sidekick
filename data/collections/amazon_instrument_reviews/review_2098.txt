My Strat has bigger frets than any guitar I have ever owned, and I have a tendency to sharp notes played on thinner gauges, particularly on the 3rd string. This 11 to 49 set feels more like my acoustic guitars and minimizes the problem of sharp notes from too much finger pressure, while still feeling "faster" than an acoustic guitar. They sound great, last a long time, stay in tune and are a good compromise between very light gauges and the really heavy sets.
