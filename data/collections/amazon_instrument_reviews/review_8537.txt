I have had this pedal for a while and prefer it to my boss dd7 and the anolog is much more natural sounding. Its said that its not actually an anolog pedal however I think it does a good job at mimicking anolog sound. Ive played guitar and bass for over 10 years and had a few decent pedals in that time. I might be embarrassed about the label but not the sound. great pedal.
