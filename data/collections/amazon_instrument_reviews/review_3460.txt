At one point I had a strong hatred for these strings on my strat, but then I smartened up, worked my calluses to the point where I could probably play 13-62's tuned to E with no trouble, and realized that these strings worked great for my strat, because of the strong tone that these provide, and ease of bending on the upper frets. These strings also are good for Les Pauls, where the scale length is shorter than the Fender guitars, making bending like velvet.
