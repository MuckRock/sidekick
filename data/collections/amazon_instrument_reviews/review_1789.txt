This acoustic pickup is the most amazing thing ever. It has a very warm and soft tone and picks up notes very well. I couldn't be happier with the purchase. It's a very good investment if you play guitar but don't have an electric acoustic. I don't think I'll ever even buy an electric acoustic now since I have this thing. Prolly sounds better anyway!!
