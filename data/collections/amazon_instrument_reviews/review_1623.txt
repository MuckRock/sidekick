I was using a Kyser capo, until the spring action loosened up to the point it wouldn't hold all the strings down.  I thought I'd try something else out and settled on this one.  It's easy to take on and off. It's tight enough.  The main positive is that the part that lays against your strings is longer than a kyser so I think it will fit even the widest fretboards.  I don't know about a 7 or 8 string though.
