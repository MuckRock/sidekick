I have a lot of guitar tuners in the house. I've had few handheld units, some apps on my phone, the Korg Pitch Black, some Fender thing, the Boss TU-3, and the TC Electronic Polytune. I can say that the only tuner that I prefer over this one is the Pitch Black. This little CA1 is actually faster and better than the TU-3 by a hair, and absolutely kills the Polytune in speed and accuracy. Korg really knows how to build their tuners, and this one is a truly great one. Works great for acoustic guitars as well as electric, and also does a fine job on basses, too. I don't know if it's accurate enough for a piano, but it is what it is.
