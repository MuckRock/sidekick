You really have to play around with all the knobs to find the perfect tone, I was able to sort of dial in a nice Marshall '80s alt-rock sound, but when you're not playing it can have a noisy wind-like feedback coming from your amp; but it can vary from amp to amp. You can fiddle with the Voice and Drive knobs to clear it up, but that usually results in a drop in your overdrive or distorted sound. But to be perfectly honest, it's pretty impressive the sound you get out of this for less than $40.
