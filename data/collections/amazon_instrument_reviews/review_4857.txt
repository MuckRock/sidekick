I figured I would take 2mins out of servicing the line of ladies that formed after receiving this pic to do a review.  The pics shape and thickness is actually perfect (TWSS) for playing and gripping.  Also the paint seems to be holding after quite a few hours of playing.  I would suggest getting two packs since you will need 1 pick and the other 11 can go to the children you fathered due to this pic.
