I've used these straplocks for many years on all my electric instruments; they're fairly inexpensive, and I've never had a problem with them, never broke one nor had to replace them because of wear/abuse, and I've NEVER had a guitar/bass hit the floor.  A couple of warnings here, which have nothing to do with the quality of the straplocks: 1.) you need to make sure the screw is snug in the hole; some people put a matchstick, toothpick, piece of paper or SOMETHING inside the hole to tighten it up if the hole's too big or has been stripped out; I use a touch of Elmer's Glue, screw in the straplock, and let it sit for a day.  2.) You have to make sure the ends that fasten to your strap are securing enough of the strap so that it doesn't work itself off the end; use a socket to get the nut really tight.  New straps seem to be easier to secure.
