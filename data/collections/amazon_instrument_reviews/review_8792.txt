I usually stickup to the OverDrive pedals, asking tons of sound from tubes and extra overdrives. Still, I needed a Distortion that could cover of the Marshall sound-like roar JCM-800... and this guy did the job! It's not a Riot, but... pretty much defends its self from the old 70-80s songs. Love it!
