I have found that everything Schaller make's is Grade A-#1 in My book. Made in Germany ( NOT China ) these locks are fast and secure. I like the way they slide on & off which if Your like Me having to change Guitar's during a show or just at home, the change is smooth and safe. No dropping guitar's around here !!! I have them on all My guitar's.
