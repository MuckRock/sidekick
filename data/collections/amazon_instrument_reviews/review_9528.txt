These are solid stands for holding your guitars. I use them with my six string acoustic and my six string electric guitars and they work great. They are an excellent value.The reason they are so important to have is that, by having your guitars out and available to play, you will get more practice. They help me pick up my guitars much more often. Instead of dragging out the case and getting a single 20 minute session, I might get 4 or 5 10 minute sessions a night -- more on the weekends.Stands of this quality were about three times the cost at my local music store. I highly recommend these for around the house use.
