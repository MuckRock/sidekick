These strings sound great, play great, and the coating really does keep down the squeaking. Some purists don't like the coating movement when it comes to strings, and it does take a micron off the treble, but they last a loooong time. I usually only have to change my strings once a month. I use them on my Washburn acoustic guitar, and play rock, folk, and country strumming. They rock, and I feel they are the best strings around today, period.  These strings are very small, and are great for playing for long periods of time, without brutalizing the fingertips. Some people say the real light strings are not good for recording, and you probably have less of a bass boom, but I like 'em.
