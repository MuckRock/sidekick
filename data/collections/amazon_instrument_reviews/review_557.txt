I've been using these Fender straplocks over the last year:Fender 099 0818 300 F Straplock ChromeThe problem with those is that they use screws to secure that part that is on the strap itself, and the screw will slowly back itself out and you get yourself a disaster. I've decided to try these because they use a "dual" system: you can use the lock on your strap, or just use your "regular" strap without the locking mechanism. I've only been using these for a week, but so far, I like them much better than Fender's. I think I will replace all Fender straplocks with these.I do agree with the others on the fact that the screws are of lower quality, and the screw heads will strip if you're not careful. When I was installing these strap nuts, I screw in a half turn at a time, and applied lots of pressure so that the the head won't strip. If you can get over the installation, you got yourself a pretty good locking strap.
