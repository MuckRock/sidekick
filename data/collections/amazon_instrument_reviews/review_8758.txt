I honestly don't know how they can sell these cases for the price and give you free shipping too. I've seen cheap quality chipboard cases and gig bags that cost more. This is a hard shell tolex covered case. They are sturdy, well padded with plush black lining, and look as good as cases costing much more. These cases are made for dreadnought guitars, and I bought two of them. One is for my Ibanez AK75G arcrhtop electric guitar and it fits perfectly. The case has 4 brass latches and one is lockable and comes with 2 keys. It's made in China, but isn't most everything these days? I wouldn't recommend it for airline/railroad baggage, but this case will offer ample protection and safe storage for your instrument under most other conditions. I don't think you'll find a better deal on a hard shell guitar case anywhere else. Don't be fooled by the popular belief that more expensive is better. Do yourself a favor and save a few bucks by buying one of these great cases!
