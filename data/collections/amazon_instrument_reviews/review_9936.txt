There are lots of ways to tune a guitar ranging from using a tuning fork to sitting next to a properly tuned piano. I've also used a variety of electronic tuners over the years with everything from rows of flashing lights to meters with a needle. There are some excellent tuners out there with tone generators, metronomes, etc. built in. But this device is simple, portable, easy to use, and just plain works. It's also cheap enough that even if you have other types of tuners, it's worth the money to get one of these for each guitar case. Aside from its simplicity, it's also less bothered by background noise, as other units with microphones might be.
