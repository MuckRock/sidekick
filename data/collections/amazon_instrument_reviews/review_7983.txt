When you're looking into a quality cable you wouldn't expect to find such quality for this price range. The construction is solid, well insulated cording, and having done some test recording with it I will definitely be purchasing more of these as the studio expands.While there may be more expensive cables out there I feel that for the price you are getting something of a higher quality than you would expect. Didn't notice any defects and no static/noise-bleed despite being around lots of other audio equipment, monitors, etc. Even touring or in a mobile studio application I wouldn't be worried about this cable failing or noise bleed.Only regret is not picking up a few more at this price, but I'm sure to order more for future expansion.Not worried at all about using this cable as part of my signal chain and was relieved to have it shipped out and arrive in a timely manner.Quality product, quality vendor.
