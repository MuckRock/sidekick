I play in small tight places..  Sometimes, People dance right in front of us..  I actually bought one of these  for my partner because for some reason, he would put his stand high and only use 1/3 of his boom to hold his microphone..  the rest of his boom arm stuck out into the crowd and because it was so tight, drunk dancers would bump into the boom part of the stand knock his microphone into his teeth..  Despite me telling him that he should just adjust his boom differently, he wouldn't and would continue to get annoyed by the drunk dancers.When I saw this, I thought it would make a nice christmas gift..  He does use it in the one place that he has problems but only here for some reason..I bought one for myself as well and I do like it..  The plastic piece that holds the extruding part to the other side of the boom does not stay in though..  It comes apart quite easily..  My only complaint..What I do love is that the teeth on the boom angle that connects to the stand holds the boom and it doesn't slip down at all!  I personally love that because I have had Boom arms that &#34;Go Limp&#34; and their is nothing more annoying!!
