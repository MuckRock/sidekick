I bought this with super saver shipping 5-8 days and it came in 3 so I was very happy about that. Also the lightning itself looks awesome and the black in the background is darker in person than in the (low quality) picture. One more thing is that the strap locks on very well by it self (I have a big problem with that because the strap that came with my guitar sucked) But hell this one is amazing. I bought this one for my black fender and I think I'm going to buy a white tribal for my white Ibanez Grg120bdx. Great product cant go wrong especially with the double sided design and the price.
