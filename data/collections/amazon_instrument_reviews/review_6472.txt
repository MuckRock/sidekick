I have used this pedal on both myRoland RD-300NX Digital Pianoand myRoland V-Combo VR-700and it's one hundred percent compatible with both. One nice feature that ensures compatibility is the polarity switch that enables it to work with just about any brand and model keyboard.It's well constructed and I have not encountered any issues with the two-piece bottom. In fact, after over a year of use on carpet issues reported by another have not surfaced. If anything this pedal is as good as new.The feel is superb. There is positive resistance as you depress the pedal and the spring tensions it in such a manner that you can control exactly the rate of depression or release. It is not so tight as to fatigue, but the response is positive.Another feature I love is the six foot cord length - it gives you room to place the pedal when you have tiered keyboards and multiple pedals on the floor. The cable itself and the plug look to be high quality and have withstood over a year of constant use with no problems.If you are looking for an inexpensive, but not cheaply made, pedal that will work with just about any keyboard this one is worth considering. I am sold on it and would replace it with an identical pedal if something happens to this one.
