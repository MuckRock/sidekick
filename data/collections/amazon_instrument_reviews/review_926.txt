I've used these for more than two years but recently shifted to its big brother, the jazz 3 XL. Same thickness and feel /tone, but in a larger form factor. I would definitely recommend the XL version if rhythm+lead work is required. For strictly solo work with easy to achieve pinch harmonics, this one is better.
