I have two of these. High quality build. Out of personal preference...this capo design works best for me. Tension is perfect for my Washburns. One has light strings & the other has medium. I thought this was worth mentioning since the diameter of the strings might affect the clamping tension. Both of them sound like there was no capo on. Overall, I'm happy with this brand. Highly recommended.
