This Levy's Leathers "2inch Cotton Guitar Strap" is good looking (in an understated sort of way), very well made, adjustable and extremely comfortable, and works exactly as expected.We bought this for my son as a "starter" strap and figure he will buy a more flashy one someday, but this one looks like it will be used for the foreseeable future!Highly Recommended!CFH
