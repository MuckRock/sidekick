I bought this stand primarily to hold my Epiphone Les Paul. I have owned the other cheaper stands which are not built as well as the Hercules. The stand holds the guitar in place by the neck and the bottom of the guitar rests on the padding of the stand legs. There is no room for movement of the guitar like you fins with other stands. I can also move the guitar in the stand from room to room without issues. I plan on buying another one to hold a rather large acoustic guitar. I like how the stand is completely adjustable and locks into place.I strongly suggest this stand for heavier guitars rather than the cheaper stands out there, the extra cost is well worth the investment. I bought this at my local guitar shop for $40 after looking into it, the manager of the guitar shop recommended it to a few people while I was there.UPDATE 11/5/12- A few weeks ago, I bought myself a second one seeing the amazon price was lower than the local retailers. I usually buy locally, but the deal here was great. The stand is worth the price and more.
