I'll be brief and to the point here:+ Works as an audio interface for a line level signal. I used this with my Samson mixer.+ Is compact and the USB cable itself is long enough.+ The red color looks nice.+ Has a headphone out with volume control+ Plug and play. No extra drivers needed. I use ASIO anyways.+ Cheap. There's NO audio interface this affordable.+ Latency fairly low. Not bad.- Plastic body- RCA connectors. Not a big deal but wouldve been perfect if it had dual plugs or phono(1/4 inch).- 44.1 khz and 16 bit sampling. Should have been 24 bit and maybe 96khz. Even my DigiTech RP255 has a built in 24bit audio interface.
