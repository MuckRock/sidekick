I got this for my Epi Sheraton II:PROS:  It fits perfectly; it's "fur" lined and has a decent sized internal compartment; it's solid and the hardware is sturdy; it has one locking latch (out of five), but nothing that would stop a real thief; it has two knobs on the bottom that allow the case to stand on end without tipping over, two knobs on the side for when you put it down on its side, and three knobs on the back that allow it to lay down without being completely on the ground; it's relatively thin.CONS:  It's heavy; the handle is positioned oddly and at an angle; it has some "Made in China" characteristics.I've had several cases and this is one of the nicest.  On a personal level, I'd prefer it didn't say "Epiphone" on the outside.  But since it does it's a good place to hide a $3000 Gibson 335.
