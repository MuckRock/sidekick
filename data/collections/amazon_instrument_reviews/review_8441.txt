Right out of the box, playable!  I did a tune up of the strings and they are holding pitch well after a couple of hours of playtime.  The electronics are just fine on the guitar I got.  I did have to adjust the string action down a bit, but hey, that goes with the territory.  There were some minor flaws in the finish, but for the money spent, this is a real workhorse and plays great!
