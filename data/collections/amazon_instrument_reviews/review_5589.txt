Years ago I owned an original edition TS808; I loved that pedal and used it for years on stage.  Eventually I sold it many years later, but I always missed that pedal, so I decided to give this reissue a try. My verdict: Awesome - It sounds just like I remember. The TS808 just has that 'certain something' that really brings out a nice smooth overdrive sound, especially when it's to enhance the overdrive sound you may already have.
