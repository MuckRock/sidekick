i needed a simple music stand to hold my music and notes when practicing in my room.  this does the trick just fine.  it is light, sort of cheap, etc., but it does what it needs to and it did not cost me an arm and a leg.  I wouldnt recommend using it for concert or stage performances but for at home, practicing, it is just fine.
