Wow, I will never buy another SM-57 again. I can't believe I'm writing this, but it's ture. I am so psyched that I found this microphone, it's perfect.But seriously, the sound quality has never once disappointed me. In fact, and it might just be in my head, but I now prefer to use this when micing my guitar amp. But everyone else has talked about sound, so I want to talk about build quality.It's solid, has some weight to it, and the plastic at the top feels exactly right: so far, it hasn't come loose in the way that SM-57s do. If I handed this and a SM-57 to my grandma who doesn't know any better, she'd probably guess that the ES-57 was a bit higher-end. I continually look at it and can't believe I only paid $30 for it.Get one. Nah, get a bunch! Sell your SM-57s for $60 and turn them into two of these. Magic!
