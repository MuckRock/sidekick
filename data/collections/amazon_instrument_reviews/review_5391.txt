I wouldn't consider this a $30 backup mic, I would consider this a professional vocal mic.  Period.  This is a great mic!  Out of the box, it has a nice weight to it.  It sounds slightly hotter than say, a Shure SM58; which is why I like it so much.  I typically like to stand back from a mic when I sing live and this seems to work very well for my vocals with that technique.  I have also tested this mic with harmonica as well.  Seriously... I don't work for the company or have any ties whatsoever.  I'm just a dude in a band.  Trust me on this one.
