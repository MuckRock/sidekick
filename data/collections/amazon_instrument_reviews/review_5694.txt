I am completely blown away with these headphones. The second I got them in the mail I plugged it up to my mac pro, opened up itunes and played a song. Simply put it was amazing, I was able to hear EVERY single track individually! I later plugged the ATH-M50's into a Korg triton studio, recorded a session with some great microphones and edited a project in final cut all with the same results. The sound is so clear with these headphones you will notice every flaw no matter how small in whatever you are working on (which is a great thing). I have worked with a lot of headphones including some that cost many times what these do and I keep coming back. I have seen a few people comment that the bass is not "punchy enough" this is simply not true, the bass is amazing, any stronger and these headphones would not be true to the source. Make no mistake the ATH-M50's are extremely accurate and sound fantastic.
