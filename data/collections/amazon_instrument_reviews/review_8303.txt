I first used the Snark when I borrowed a friends before a show, and I thought it was the coolest thing in the world. He used it to tune his acoustic electric, and at first I thought it was working off of sound, but then I put it on the headstock of my unplugged electric, and it picked it up instantly, and tuned it perfectly. I couldn't beleive it. I had to have one. I ordered the one that is capable of both miced tuning, and vibration tuning, as well has having the tap beat metronome, and I am in love with it. It's SO sensitive, and so accurate, you can turn the mic off, and use it to tune your electric guitar in a VERY loud room, and it won't pick up ambient noises. LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT. I recommend this to ALL musicians. The mic feature would be useful on your music stand, or attached to your trumpet, tuba, saxophone, whatever... clamp it on, and play. Absolutely awesome.
