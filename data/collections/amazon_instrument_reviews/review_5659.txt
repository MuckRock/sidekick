Dunlop always makes top-notch products, so when it came time to find a slide, I knew where to look. This one produces a great tone, and is well-made. Like the other reviewers mention here, you might want to invest in a slide case to prevent this thing from getting smashed to bits. For general home use though, I wouldn't worry about it too much though.
