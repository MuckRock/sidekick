I'm a professional musician, playing 6-8 times a month.  This pedal does far more than I need it to do and has plenty of options for an avid guitarist that likes to figure out all the bells and whistles.  I really like the 38 second looping function.....that's plenty of time to get through some lengthy phrases, and it allow you to layer the loops so you can really get creative.  Don't forget to order the external power supply - I would have happily paid a little extra money to have it included....not sure why it's not.  Double A batteries last a longer time than I expected they would.  I haven't had a chance to play with customizing patches, etc, but I'm sure that I'll be pleased with what it has to offer.
