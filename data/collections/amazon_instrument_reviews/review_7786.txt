Excellent replacement upgrade for the inexpensive but fantastic Squire Strat series.  This Bridge has more strength and solidness than the original.  Replace the Tremelo Arm with the one offered on Amazon as well.Key:  This bridge is slightly thicker/higher than the one it replaces on the Squire, so the back plate won't fit back on...something to mod if you need a backplate, but the difference in the quality make it worth the loss.
