I bought this to connect a Technics TT with an Audio Technica cartridge to my newer Onkyo receiver with no phono input. The unit did work but I had to turn the volume to 80 (out of 100) to get any reasonable volume. In addition I have an Onkyo M3040 connected to the receiver that I use for as a zone 2 amplifier. With this preamp I am getting some serious spikes into the amp. They are not audible but the lights would dim and the volume from the zone 2 speakers would drop. I do not have this problem with any other source so it appears to be some signal from this preamp.This unit may work perfectly fine with a Behringer mixer but for my use it doesn't meet my needs at all. I am returning it.
