Best straplocks I have ever had! In almost 30 years of guitar playing, I have tried many straplocks: cheap, expensive, nickel, steel, gold... youn name it, I have tried it. These are the best, topping any other by far. More secure than all competitors, never wear out at all, locking system never fails and these always maintain their fantastic looks and for a very long time. I have them in Chrome in every guitar I own. Highly recommended. Cheers!
