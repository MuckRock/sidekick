This strap looks really great and fits just as advertised........it's just that it gets in the way (for Me and my chording skills) mounted as designed and shown. I altered the mounting manner to accomodate MY style and it functions fine.(Looks great, too) High quality and compliments the Martin Name and reputation really well. I feel that it's a good deal and  recommend it!
