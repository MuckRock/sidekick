I scored a virtually unused pre-owned unit for $50.  It is packed with features and there is a little bit of a learning curve if you want to really make use of the features, but simple plug and play operation is possible.  My original thought was to use the unit as an interface for recording on my PC.  My only gripe- and it is considerable - is that the unit sounds too digital to me- particularly as the chord or note starts to decay and fade.  I probably would have loved this thing when I started playing (more years ago than I care to admit).  I prefer a genuine tube driven amp with analog pedals.  Does that make me a 'gear snob'?  Not when you consider that low watt tube amps and cheaply manufactured pedals can be had for peanuts these days ;)  I've also owned a Tech 21 Trademark 60 analog modeling amp (not bad but traded) and still have a Tech 21 TRI AC analog preamp(great pedal and a keeper)- both are 'modelers' and both sounded better to my ears than digital modelers.  I just prefer analog all the way around.  I eventually gave the unit away to someone who has just taken up the guitar.  He likes it fine-  I gave 3 stars because it's a good way for junior to experement with effects and to practice without annoying the neighbors.
