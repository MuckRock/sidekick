They said you could hook up a volume pedal to raise and lower the note you're playing up to three octaves, but I could never get that feature to work properly.From video reviews I've heard on YouTube, this Harmonizer does not even come close to the Boss version, but it costs about $100 less.  Since I am not a professional musician and I am just playing around with it, it works just fine.  And ... you get what you pay for.Addendum:  I've now owned this for a while, and discovered that it can turn my six-string Strat into a bass, by turning the balance knob all the way to the right, and my pitch on the second from bottom position.  In fact, when I record my Dean Edge bass onto the Boss Loop Station and then record my Strat on top of it using the Behringer  Ultra Shifter/Harmonist, I cannot tell any difference in tonality.I am thinking of selling my bass.  It has just become a needless expense.  Needs the neck adjusted twice a year, the strings are expensive, and it is harder to play then my Strat.
