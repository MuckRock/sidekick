Subjective: Nice thing is that it's fairly transparent - there's no changes to the top/bottom end that the tone knob can't fix, and it's fairly good in the transitions area. All gain pedals can do gain - but how it transitions from dirt to clean is what sets them apart...this handles it well. Pluck a string and let it sit, and it slowly cleans up. Some pedals it slowly cleans up to a point then it just goes to bleh.That said, setting it with the volume all the way up, and the drive all the way down, and roll off a bit of the tone knob to 11:00, and using the switch on LF - into the front end of my Mesa Boogie Roadster on Ch3/Modern = pure GOLD. That's the sound I've been looking for out of this amp!So far I've only used it on a few of my amps, and, so far, I've not found it to be unusable or even as a one-trick pony. I'm impressed, and that says a lot for someone who just a few years ago, hated the idea of putting anything between his guitar and his amp...if the amp couldn't do it 'naturally' when it comes to dirty tone...then it's the wrong amp...I still think that way, but a good pedal up front can add a nice twist...and goose that front end a bit where shifting channels might not be what the Dr. ordered...
