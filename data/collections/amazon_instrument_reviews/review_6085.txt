For about 30 yrs. have been playing finger style only - usually with alternating bass, and never really used a pick so this seemed like a good first choice.For the song I was performing, chords were Bm, E, F#m, and G (1st & 3rd position) and I needed to back up the singer so it was really just strumming with a tiny bit of playing just the first two strings as an intro.I found a very old and very thin Peavey pick unintentionally picking up what looked like the blue Dava in the bottom of my guitar case and it worked perfectly so I then ordered the Fender Abalone Thin picks and find they make playing chords quite easy.Fender 351 Premium Celluloid Guitar Picks, 12 Pack, Abalone, ThinMy ancient Peavey broke in half not long after, and I continued using the stub turned sideways while waiting for the new Fender picks to arrive because I liked the extra flex)Seems like more advanced players like at least a medium to better pick individual strings, but since I never liked using a pick at all, the Fender Thin works best for me and I'm enjoying learning to use it on songs like Eric Clapton's interpretation of Bessie Smith's "Nobody Knows You..."I'll try the Dava picks again later if I feel the need. I play Simon and Garfunkel's version of Scarborough Fair which is exclusively finger picking and George Harrison's "Here Comes the Sun" - where he uses a pick, but it is still easier for me to pick out the individual notes fingerstyle.This is all on an acoustic 6 string steel guitar, using D'Addario EJ16 Phosphor Bronze light strings.Bristol by Blueridge BD-16 Dreadnaught Acoustic Guitar (Natural)D'Addario EJ16 Phosphor Bronze Acoustic Guitar Strings, LightFor the rank beginner who has never picked up a pick before, the Fender thin makes it easier to strum because the pick flexes so it's not as essential to turn your wrist as much to get the pick to move smoothly over the strings.The grip is better on the Dava, but they aren't going to flex as much. Undoubtedly better for more accomplished players. Most advice I've seen says try 'em all and decide for yourself. I was just amazed and delighted how much easier the Fender thin made it for me to get started.
