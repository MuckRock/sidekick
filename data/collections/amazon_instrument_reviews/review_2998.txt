I only recently started playing the guitar, and as a beginner, I wanted to get a less expensive strap to go with my less expensive guitar.This one came at a great price and it's sturdy enough for me, so I think this is very decent strap for the price I paid for it.  It's quite comfortable to wear and adjusts very easily.
