So, these ended up being the wrong taper for my guitar, but that was my own fault due to some incorrect advice.  Nonetheless, I put a couple in just to compare them to my old, plastic pins.  What a difference!  Unquestionably, the sound board was far more sensitive.  Sustain was much better and I got a richer tone, as opposed to the brighter tone some users reported.  I should say, however, what I got was definitely the true, ebony wood pins with the inlay.  I can't speak to concerns about plastic being used for the other pin colors.  While these won't work due to size, I'll definitely be making the switch from plastic to ebony when I find the right size.
