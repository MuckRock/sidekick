I bought this to replace another adapter that came with the Yamaha keyboard I bought at Costco long time ago.The original adapter was bulky and heavy and that's what caused the wires inside to break.Tried to stripped the rubber coating and soldered the wires together, but after short use, the heavy head of the adapter still ripped the wires apart.When it is big and heavy, when you unplug it, sometimes the kids hold the cable instead of the adapter.But the cable can not support the weight thus making it rip.This new design is actually a bit more powerful but only a fraction of the weight and size.It works beautifully the moment I plugged it in.BTW, I am using this NOT on the CP series.  It actually works for the cheaper keyboards too.My CP33 has this identical adapter which I tested on the other cheap keyboard before I bought it.It's great.And shipping was fast.
