What can you say... at less than $30(incl shipping), it's a steal! I was looking for a VERY inexpensive version of the popular Sansamp, and this does it for me.  Decent SVT, flip top or "fat tube" tone, and a nice quiet DI.  I go DI to the house, and the output into my old Seymour Duncan amp/Aguilar GS410 cab. Great tone!! I'm using a 9VDC Class II wall wart (found it in my "spare parts" closet) vs 9V batteries.  With the wall wart, no DI hum = Great! Does eat batteries, so get yourself a power supply. Never use the foot switch; if used at all, I use my finger.  If broken or lost(who would steal it?), I'd buy another in a heart beat!
