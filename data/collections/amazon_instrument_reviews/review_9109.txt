I recently purchased a Epiphone EB-3 bass and it didn't come with a case/bag. So when I found this one and decided for the price it was worth the try. It is VERY thinly padded not much more then a dust cover really. Not to mention that it has issues fitting a side by side into the bag but inlines seem to fit just fine. All in all it's an okay bag but only if you have an inline and don't want much padding.
