As with all Boss / Roland products, the Boss FS-6 performs as designed. I purchased it to control both my Boss ME 20 Multi effects pedal and my Fender Blues Jr amp. The A switch (in non latching mode) allows me to cycle through stored effects banks in my ME 20 and the B switch (in latching mode) allows me engage and disengage the FAT (overdrive) switch on my Blues Jr Amp. Everything works exactly as planned. The FS-6 rugged, compact (fits right into my into ME 20 carrying case) and easy to use.I read a few reviews where people were complaining about batteries...something to complain about. As with most guitar players I don't use batteries in my effects pedals I use an 9 volt AC/DC adapter. Visual Sound offers the "One Spot" AC/DC adapter kit that has a 9 volt battery snap connector adapter. I removed the battery cover, then using a small rat tail file I carefully cut a notch in the battery cover for the snap connector to pass through. I then put rubber feet (purchased at ACE Hardware) on the bottom to allow the snap connector cable...battery problem solved.I also use the FS-6 as a sustain pedal for my Yamaha YPG 225 portable grand piano and a control for my RC-3 Loop Station simultaneously. The possibilities are limited only to your imagination. It is somewhat expensive but it is a Great Product!! If you need a duel switch then I highly recommend purchasing the FS-6.
