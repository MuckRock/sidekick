I bought these for supplemental mics for a podcast, verbal audio recordings.  The sound quality is very good from these mics, in fact its hard to distinguish the difference on non-pro mixers from other higher end mics.  They feel good in your hand, nice build quality, and if you put a windscreen on them there is very little pop.  Sensitivity is good, and I'm very pleased by this purchase.  I'd definitely recommend these for any kind of audio recording, they may even be a good option for instrument recording given the lower price tag.  NOTE: once you put the pop screens on, they no longer fit into the carry case.  You have to remove the wind screens or modify the cushioning inside the case.
