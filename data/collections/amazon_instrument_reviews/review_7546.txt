I bought this pedal after looking at the Boss TU-3 and Korg Pitch Black for bass. This pedal won over the mini version because of the bass mode. Strumming all 4 or 5 strings works well for a quick tune, but I still use the chromatic function to get an exact tune. The accuracy is impressive and this pedal even worked well with the low B.I read all over bass forums and reviews of the tuner and thought to try it out. TC electronics seems to spend alot of time advertising its products in bass mags and online and some of their products are greatly overhyped IMO, but this pedal and the reviews speak for themselves.I was able to tune an electric acoustic guitar in seconds using the sweep option and even tried a cigar box guitar reading just the AD&G; strings and it worked okay.The pedal is easy to use and switching between tuning modes is a breeze. I chose to keep the clear film over the display for now to preserve the display as long as I can. I tested this sweep option on an old Ibanez artcore guitar which hasn't been played for years and even with old strings, I got a reasonable tune out of it.Strumming all strings at once seems to work better with a guitar more than a bass, but many reviews in bass mags and online also point this out although it works for a quick tune.I am happy with the pedal and hope it lasts as long as my old Boss TU-2. I feel it has changed my tuning needs into a breeze.
