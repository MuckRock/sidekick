These are amazing. I'm an intermediate player. Have been for the last 30 years. I tend to have sweaty hands and loose grip. Every other pick I have used has turned in my fingers...loose grip, little sweat, slick finish. Ok now...thin? med? heavy? You can choose the stiffness just by where you hold the pick. Incredible how the stiffness will change depending on where you hold it. And I can even hold onto it. Very nice grip on these. I have to keep getting more cuz everytime I hand one to someone to try, it's the last time I see it. Just hit Add to cart. You won't be sorry
