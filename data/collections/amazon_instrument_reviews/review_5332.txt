Construction and Use: 5/5The connectors and shielding on these cables are good and do not introduce much noise into a system.The manufacturer has done a good job on this cable, but the user is responsible for two things (this addresses complaints I see in other reviews):1) Take care of your cables. The right angle plug side is much stronger than the straight plug side; this is by design. Take good care of your cables and it should last you quite a long time. This includes taking the time to store them for use.2) Make sure you know what length you need for a cable. The shorter the cable, the better for studio use. It reduces signal travel time and potential for interference (though these cables are shielded so the latter concern is moot). If you need a longer cable, buy a longer cable. Don't buy what is advertised as 5' cable and then write a negative review when you really needed a 15' cable.
