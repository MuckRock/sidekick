Small enough to keep along with your guitar to make sure it is in tune each time you play a little. I wish it was a little faster but it is close to as fast as my Sony and Korg plug in tuners. It clips onto the guitar easily, stays put, and is not intrusive by weight or size. The bars are easy to see and are accurate.
