Replaced the plastic saddle in my Yamaha F335BL. Had to file it to make it thinner, and filed it down to make it shorter than the old saddle, this made the action a bit lower and made it easier to play for a beginner. It did change the sound of the guitar, it sounds fuller, and the sustain is longer.
