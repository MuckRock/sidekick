This Joyo JF-34 US dream distortion box is very well made and produces a good range of distortion effect. My son has taken up playing guitar about a year or so ago and now that he is past the basics he was interested in trying different techniques. This box can be set to make minimal distortion or maxed out to produce very heavily distorted effects.The box is very good quality, with nice large controls and metal foot switch. The unit can be powered with a 9v battery or via an external power source (not included).This is a fun way to add distortion effects for guitar players.Highly Recommended!CFHNote: Manufacturer provided unit for review but that in no way influences my rating or comments.
