I was really looking forward to receiving this amp. I read the positive reviews and the Ampeg name carries some weight. Unfortunately, from the moment I plugged it in there was this phaser-like effect to the sound. I tried different basses with it. I tried different cables with it. I tried using it in different places, away from computers and fluorescent lights. I tried all different combinations of all of those things and still the spacey phase-shifter sound came out. I tried all different knob and EQ settings as well. Nothing helped. So, I'm returning it and hoping I just got a bad egg and that the next one will be better. I used to work for an amp manufacturer so I know these things happen and I don't think less of Ampeg, (at least not yet).I really hope it's a better amp because the amp itself looks wonderful. For $99 it's packed with cool features like an effects send, a CD in, a Line out for hooking up to a PA and a headphone out for quiet practice. It also just looks cool and very pro. My intention is to use this for a monthly "bistro" gig where the volume is low and the area is pretty small, so this seems absolutely perfect if I get one that performs like all the other reviews I see here.I have to say, buying from Amazon is the ONLY way to buy these things online. They immediately started the process of shipping me a new one as soon as I filled out the return UPS label. If there is a choice between Amazon.com and other vendors, and even if Amazon is a couple bucks more, I recommend using Amazon. The customer service is so easy and immediate it's worth the piece of mind.I'll update this review when I get the new amp later this week.I upgraded my review based on the replacement I received...see below...
