I just received these cables today and the packaging they come in is quite simple. However, there are two zip ties that secure the cables together so you will need to be careful when cutting them not to damage the cable itself with your knife or scissors.These are, "Value" cables after all. However, they seem very sturdy and are perfect for budget home recording studio use. I like how Audio Technica made something like an XLR cable look so pleasing to the eyes.As for quality, so far I've been getting a clean signal, even with my cheap Pyle Pro PDMIC58. I had to replace the cable that came with that mic because it was really that awful. Hopefully the AT Value cable will hold up! I'll update this review if anything happens.If your looking for a decent cable for a low price, I would give these a try.
