These dual amplified speaker cabinets are something new for me, as I am used to the normal dual cabinet, one amplified set up like the Behringer MS16 which I was trying to replace with these, but on second thought will set them up someplace else, as they do not have front controls, have only one trs or XLR connection point, require AC power for both, and as P Frary has stated are VERY dependent on input; they kind of worked with my Stanton S300, and not at all with my laptop.They are (as stated by other reviewers) very subtle, and may take some getting used to. Because of the dual amps, you don't hear the sound travel from cabinet to cabinet, as each speaker cabinet is a stand alone unit.I actually hooked one up like a guitar amp, and it worked fine; just a little guitar amp that sounded great.For your normal Stereo mini jack and RCA hook ups, I would go with the much lower priced MS16's which have multiple RCA jack in points, and one Stereo mini and full front controls.Addendum: 10/13I finally hit a home run with these speaker when I hooked them up to Sony CD changer unit I have for the living room, dialed in the speakers, and put them both on one on/off switch.  The soundis full, and fills the room.
