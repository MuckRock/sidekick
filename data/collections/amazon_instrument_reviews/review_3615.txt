This mike is a great way to start recording at home. I use it with a small behringer mixer and garageband on my mac and just having a ball. I know its not the nice wiz bang high dollar type and maybe their are others just as good for the price. However, I find the mic being real step up from using dynamic mikes for recording at home.
