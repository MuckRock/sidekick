Just exactly as stated, this is a small rubber piece to hook on your mic stand or guitar stand. Holds 6 picks. It is exactly what I wanted for a great price. Thanks!Editing this review to say that today I got a few thin picks and the "thin" picks do not hold in this. Mediums do great but the thin fall right out. Fine for me because I will just keep medium in it but just thought it might be helpful information for someone.
