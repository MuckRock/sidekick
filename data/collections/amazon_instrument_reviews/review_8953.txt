What a fantastic product! I believe I have been wishing for this for years!Only one problem. Make sure that you want that pedal there - because once it sticks - you will have a difficult time removing it from that spot.No longer are my pedals going to become disconnected after travel - they actually stay attached to the pedal board!I have ordered two more to do more pedals and boards - this stuff works and is T-U-F-F!I you are having problems with your pedals becoming unattached from your board after driving to and setting up at the club then this is the product you need!I just wish I could get paid for endorsing this product!*********************************Still holding strong - building another board and using this stuff - it's much better than regular velcro - I don't have time for pedals falling off of my board in transit - use this and that annoying issue goes away.
