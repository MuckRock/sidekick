I ordered these as my first mic cords for a pair of dynamic mics I recently bought. They are very flexible, easy to handle, and of good quality. Even though the jacket material is flexible, it seems strong, and I have no fear of it tearing. The ends are sturdy metal, and they include a pair of velcro straps to keep the unused length (if any) under control. I am very satisfied with these cords, and would highly recommend them.
