I realized I didn't have any distortion pedals, only a bunch of overdrive pedals, so I set out to find a distortion pedal.  After scouring the forums I find out the pedals that are supposed to be very good are also very pricey.  Since I don't want to spend a bunch of money I get this one and it is great, albeit quite bright.  The only thing I don't like about this pedal is the brightness, which can be tamed with the tone knob, otherwise it is easy to use, sounds really good and is transparent. Transparent in that it doesn't add a lot of color to your amp just distortion.  I use this pedal with vintage Fender Silverface amps, which are already bright, so I turn the tone more to the bass side and also shape my tone with the Spark Booster that I have in front of the US Dream. I have to use the Spark Booster to hit the US Dream hard because most of the guitars I use don't have hot enough pickups.The price was right, I'm happy with it.
