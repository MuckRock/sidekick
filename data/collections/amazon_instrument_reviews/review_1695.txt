These Fender Medium picks are simple basic good picks that just work well. Color and appearance is a personal thing, I think these abalone picks just look cool. The color mix is random (no two picks are exactly the same); some have a bit more blue and reflective colors in them. Overall, the effect is not bad compared to real abalone.Fender makes a nice standard pick. The three weights are pretty easy to figure out (light, medium, and heavy). These mediums work well for playing electric guitar. I have some light red ones that have a lot of flex. Those work well for acoustic. I've used Dunlop with the little bumps for grip, and the Dava rubber coated picks. They are all nice, but sometimes you just want a regular old smooth pick. The gray Dunlop's don't look anywhere near as cool as these.At $3 for a dozen, they're worth a try. It they don't work out for playing, they sure look darn nice (the Fender logo is in gold).Dava 6024 Grip TipDunlop Nylon Standard Picks, Grey .73mm
