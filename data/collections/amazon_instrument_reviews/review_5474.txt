I am a beginner guitar player. I have a Yamaha F335BL and a Hohner HC06.  I bought the Yamaha a few years back, and just recently started to really learning to play it.  It sounds ok, but not great (though the Price is pretty good for it)  It is all laminated, and the action is pretty high.Looking online I saw that people really liked the Seagull S6 Original for its sound and price point. Boy were they right. I got this guitar from Guitar Center (after I tried it out)  The action is low, and the fretboard is bigger (for fingerstyle and beginners this is really good).  The sound is also REALLY good, its very resonant, and just sounds &#34;good&#34;.  It is hard to describe the sound, you woul dhave to hear it.I did replace the pins with Presentation Tusq Pins, I could not really tell a difference in sound, but it did make it look nicer.Highly recommend this and other guitars from Seagull (try the Merlin, its fun)
