I'm sick of protools and I wanted to find something cheap and easy until I could afford to upgrade to some real equipment to use with cubase.  This unit fit the bill and has decent reviews so I went for it.I'm using it to record guitar and vocals and it does the trick.  The problem is that it records a lot of hum and white noise when using the xlr input.  I've tried every variation possible to make sure the problem isn't external to the unit.  I even tested the exact same mic + cable input into my MBox with protools and got a clean recording.  I actually like this unit's "tone" better than the mbox - it seems more transparent.  If not for the hum, it would get 5 stars.Unfortunately, hum is a pretty big problem.  The hum isn't loud enough to ruin your recording of only one or two tracks.  If you start layering, though, you can quickly be overtaken by white noise.  I even tried moving the unit onto a different electrical circuit and still had the same problem.So, it works for rough stuff for your own use but I wouldn't use it for anything you plan on passing around much.
