I haven't had an issue with this cable yet, and the guage of the wire connecting the plugs is very thick and high quality, but it takes a while for them to stop coiling up. Like the title says, the timeless combo of Neutrik & Mogami is better. If you're wondering how to get Neutrik/Mogami cables cheap, make them yourself. It saves you so much money!
