Product arrived in exactly condition as described by the seller.  This unit allows for great sweeping of frequencies.  the 15 dB pull in each direction for each of the seven bands are filter worthy,  My only dissatisfaction lies in the amount of noise this unit adds to my chain when engaged.  When inactive this unit is transparent, no tone suckage.  When this unit is engaged, each frequency band carves the sounds nicely however, consideration to have this unit modified to reduce its noisy output has begun for me at least.  I am thankful for the internet and the opportunities it presents for me to MOD this Pedal.
