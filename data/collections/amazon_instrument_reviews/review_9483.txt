I love these tuners.  I have tried the intel, krog, boss, etc... and out of all of them, I like the Snark the best.  Response and visual display are awesome.  Unlike a couple of the others I've used, the Snark works well on any place on the headstock.  A couple of the other brands I had to be careful where I positioned them because they didn't respond well.  You can't go wrong with any Snark.
