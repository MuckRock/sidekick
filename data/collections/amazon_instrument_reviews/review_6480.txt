This transfers my XLR mic to my USB laptop. Simply plug it in and find the right drivers. My only issue is that the device would be better if they made it with a more durable plastic. It does seem like it can break easily. Thankfully I will never have to move it around much on my desk. All in all, it works and I am pleased.
