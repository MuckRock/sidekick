Within just three seconds of using the Electro-Harmonix Pocket Metal Muff Pedal, I knew it was a winner. It delivers thermonuclear distortion and is ultra-easy to use. Although it doesn't have a tone dial, it doesn't need one. And I say that after trying it through a small tube amp (15w), a small digital amp (40w), a guitar with humbuckers, and a guitar with single-coil pickups. The closest it has to a tone dial is the scoop switch just above the on/off switch. As its name suggests, this allows one to choose how much the mid tones will be "scooped." It has three settings (no scoop to maximal scoop), and all sound great. Fans of sustain will love this box, for it delivers seemingly everlasting sustain. The pedal is extremely small, which most would regard as a plus. I bought this after watching a professional-looking YouTube demonstration of it. It more than lived up to my expectations. If I lost this box, I'd immediately order another one. I have zero regrets.
