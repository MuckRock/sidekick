This is really quite a fantastic little gizmo.  It functions flawlessly and makes tuning my guitar quick, simple, and fun.  It is easy to read from any angle (it adjusts every which way).  You just clamp it onto your guitar and it picks up the vibrations, showing you when you are sharp, flat, or dead on.  Quite amazing, especially for the price.  Highly recommend (and I'm stingy with my 5 star reviews)
