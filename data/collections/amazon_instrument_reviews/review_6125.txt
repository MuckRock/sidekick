The Korg Pitchblack is probably, along with the BOSS TU-2/TU-3, considered one of the industry standards for compact pedal bypass tuners for use with guitar and bass.  Both the TU-2 and Pitchblack are excellent, and I don't really have an opinion yet as to which is better.  However, there are some strengths of the Korg Pitchblack that may lead you to prefer it over other tuners.  The primary draw here is the bright light-up display with wide color bars.  The tuner displays the note you are closest to, and the colors guide you to the perfect pitch, marked by the green light in the middle (almost like an airplane landing guide).  But not only do the lights indicate tone by turning on and off, they actually dim and transition into one another as you go across those semi-tones.  You could argue, therefore, that the visual guide is giving you a lot more precision than you would get from a simple on/off light.  The tuner works quickly and reliably.The build quality is outstanding, and it's true bypass.  When you step on the pedal, the tuner is on and the guitar signal is off.  The switch is also of the "soft button" variety, similar to what you find on some Vox pedals and many boutiques.  It has a nice feel to it, though it could be easier to bump if it's in a high traffic area.This is a great tuner at a reasonable price.  It really comes down to user preference, but I've heard many guitarists prefer this one because of its high accuracy and visibility.
