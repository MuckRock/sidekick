This interface is alright, nothing special, its for a guy on a budget. You can use it to record your old tapes or records and it will go straight through the interface to your computer via USB. There is pretty much little to no latency and it isn't noticeable. I plan on buying a tascam interface soon for around $70.00 and that should make things better for me. I will still use this to record anything on TV or like I said, old tapes. The software bundle is pretty much free, as you can find everything on the internet, they just bundled it together for you, which is nice.
