I recently purchased two Protec guitar straps in order to avoid having to switch straps between instruments.  These straps are quite flexible length-wise, so if you have ever been disappointed by a strap that you either couldn't get short enough for a high playing position or long enough for a low playing position, you will not be disappointed here.  These are also a nice medium width, so they should be suitable for all kinds of players.  Although one reviewer complained about the size of the holes for the strap buttons, I actually find the snug fit to be an advantage:  it doesn't feel like I'll have to worry about the strap coming disconnected from the guitar.  And, the price is right.
