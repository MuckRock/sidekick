I am extremely happy with this product. I own several shoulder rests, and this quickly became my favorite and stays on my favorite violin. I have no problem whatsoever keeping it on the violin as long as it's in the proper position. The adjustability is a key factor, and I can turn one side low and the other side higher for a highly customized fit. The padding is also excellent and comfortable. A top-quality product.
