First, I don't like most distortion pedals because of instead of making my Fender Blues DeVille 410 sound distorted, they make it sound like it is amplifying a distorted pedal.  There's a difference. Think about it if you don't get it.Second, I don't like having a lot of pedals. I play in a rock/country band were we play music that sounds like Neil Young, Tom Petty, CCR, etc.  Just simple and clean rock and roll with a mix of 1,4,5 chords and an occasional minor 6th.  I just want an overdrive (my Digitech Bad Monkey) and my Arion tuner, but I need distortion when we do covers, AC/DC, Hendrix, etc.  (The DeVille can do Hendrix, if you turn it up to 7.  But of course then it's too loud.)Based on those criteria, the DigiTech CM-2 is PERFECT.  The Classic "overdrive" setting allows me to sound like Hendrix or rocking Neil Young (or any other rock band from the 60s and 70s).  The Modern setting allows me to sound more like 80s and 90s rock, e.g., Guns 'n Roses and Soundgarden.And this is important, both settings make my amp sound like IT is being overdriven.  It sounds like my tubes are being pushed to their breaking point.  It sounds fricken awesome.  It does not sound like an amplified pedal.So I can use the Bad Monkey (I've reviewed it on Amazon if you want to read it) for boosting my clean sound.  I use the CM-2 if I want to play dirtier and for covers.  Two pedals (plus the tuner) and I can play everything I want.  I'm happy.
