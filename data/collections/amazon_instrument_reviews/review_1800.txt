I'm impressed with these EXP16 guitar strings.* What I ExpectedA more dead sound than the non-coated strings they replaced. Coated strings usually lack the bright high-end brilliance that uncoated light strings have.* What I GotA very bright, yet not to twangy sound.  When I put Light strings on my acoustic, I'm going for easy playability and, most of all, a very bright and airy sound.  These deliver on both counts.* DurabilityThe coating on these strings are supposed to prolong the time between changes.  So far they are holding their tone and brightness.  I will report back after three months.  My last set started to sound dull, and exhibit more tone variation after six months (when viewed with a very sensitive tuner, it seems that my dirtier strings detune sharp a bit more on attack, the harder you strum them.  This is confirmed by the fact that they just sound out of tune to me when they get dirty).* ConclusionI will be ordering more of these.  I think they perform very well for the price. Love the bright light gauge sound and playability.
