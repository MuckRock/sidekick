I use several Behringer components in my set-up (e.g., my mixer, PA Speakers, effects, accessories, etc.) including this pedal.  I have confidence in the Behringer name and always feel like I'm getting a good solid piece of equipment that I can rely on.  This pedal is no exception - it's a sturdily built effects pedal that will give you exactly what you are looking for in a compressor pedal.  I don't like to depend on battery power for any critical components if I don't have to so I also purchased the Behringer PSU-SB Power Supply General Purpose DC 9V Power Adaptor available on Amazon along with this.  Great price, sturdily built, great compressor effect !!!
