light construction but  you get what you pay for.  so far it has functioned well and I do use it a lot.  it would be nice if it remembered what channel it was last on so when you power cycle it doesnt switch on you.  I mostly use it to feed one amp from two different instruments.  I have not noticed any sound degradation from using it.  the volume knobs are handy for sure!!
