This microphone stand it a fairly good buy.  Because it is a light and portable stand, it is not built to be fully extended with microphones, such as the Behringer XM1800S.  Adding a counter weight maybe needed if you have a heavier condenser microphone.  I found that I needed to line up one of the legs directly under the boom when it was fully extended.  As it stands, I would suggest this as a fairly good deal.
