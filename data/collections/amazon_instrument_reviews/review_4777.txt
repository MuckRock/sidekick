The Alpha is a great little interface. It accepts 2 inputs with 2 outputs going into your computer. It's powered via the USB. The &#34;mix&#34; knob is a nice feature, allowing you to hear your input more or less prominently within the playback mix without affecting the input to the DAW. I'm using cakewalk's Music Creator 6 Touch so I didn't bother to load the LE software it came with. I like cakewalk's software better anyways (just my preference). Some reviewers have commented on hearing a hiss from the unit while recording. I haven't had a problem with this. It is extremely silent save any noise I would generate anyway from my rig. All in all I feel this is a great product and definitely worth the money.
