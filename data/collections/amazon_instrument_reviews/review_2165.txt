These EXL115 .011 gauge D'Addarios are good strings at a good price.  They sound nice and bright on my Epiphone Sheraton II and particularly twangy on the lower end of the scale, which I like.  I'd rather get these and replace them periodically than try to make any kind of old strings last a long time.  The strings don't break either.
