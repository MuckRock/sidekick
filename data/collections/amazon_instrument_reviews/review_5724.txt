This is a fantastic little recorder, but not for $300.  I bought mine used for $75 on a bass player's forum in the classified section.  That was over 3 years ago.  It has recorded almost every show I play, which is about 2-5 gigs a month, plus a couple rehearsals.  I record for my own learning purposes, and sometimes to make very rough demo's (some audio is better than no audio!) and have come to really appreciate what this little gadget can do.  The interface is not perfect and there is a little bit of a learning curve with the settings, but if you use the Automatic Gain Control (AGC) setting, the recording level is taken care of.  I use Audacity to amplify when necessary, to normalize always, and to edit from .wav to .mp3.  Its pretty easy and I am no sound tech nor am I a studio engineer.And if you goof and unplug it before powering it down, no problem.  Just pull the SD card out, insert in to your computer, save the files on your computer as .raw files by changing the extension (but first make a copy of the original file so that if you make a mistake you have a backup) and import the file into Audacity as a .raw file. From there you can edit as normal and save your edited songs as .mp3 files.
