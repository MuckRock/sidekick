I bought these through Amazon about a year ago and have installed them on all of my guitars. I have both the nickel and black on heavy basses and they have never let me down. I have since installed them on an electric and acoustic guitar out of convenience and purpose. The locks work great and give you an added sense of security.The reviews of the locks speak for themselves and no matter what style of guitar, whether it's a Les Paul, strat or active bass, I would strongly suggest them. I have never used the Dunlop locks, but have heard that some Epiphone and Gibson Les Pauls have mounting holes more suited for Dunlops.One thing to note is that all of these come with their own longer screws to use if needed. I never had to use them, but they are a nice touch and ended up in the parts bin.
