This unit is the perfect solution for people whose amps do not have mute switches for tuning. It has an absolutely silent mode that mutes for tuning without clicks or pops when switched in, and its bypass (tuner off) mode is totally transparent to tone. Its 4 tuning modes make selecting one that works best for you extremely simple (I personally prefer full strobe). Its tuning is quick and accurate, and it doesn't hunt for pitches like some tuners will, especially with a 6-string bass. Its single 9-volt battery is only used when the mute/tuner mode is activated, so the battery should last a long, long time. The display is bright and clear. It's rugged, well thought out, solidly built, and simple.My only complaint is with the calibration mode: it's just a series of non-self-explanatory numbers that change when you hit the calibration button. Its explained in the manual, but could be clearer. I'd buy this again without hesitation, though.
