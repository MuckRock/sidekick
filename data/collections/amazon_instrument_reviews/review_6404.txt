If you own an American Strat or Tele, this is a must have for the neck of your prize.  I love this.  It proudly states the guitar's origin of Corona. California with the Classic Fender name scribed.  Wonderful.  I have these on all three of my Fenders.  Again, these should really come standard on all American Strats.
