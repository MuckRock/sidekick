for any sound techs that like to make things simple and easy to work,these XLR jumper cables are the way to go, and the quality is impressive . I used them for a new set of wireless mike to jump into my 16 channel board and was it so easy, my mikes are color coded and my cable fitted right in with the same color code thus making it easy to identify from afar and easy to control on the mixing board.
