I have finally learned my lesson.I have purchased a number of these over the last year or two.. and previously had the same opinion as reviewers that say "good for static applications" as the cable conductors are prone to breakage, even along the length of the cable, not just at the connectors...But they are dirt cheap so i figured that was ok.But now, after recently buying and installing a cable from a mic in a sound booth to a digital mixer I checked it out and it seemed to work.A week later an acoustic duet came to record and the mic cable made the singer sound like she was singing behind a curtain.. yup..the cable.So by all means buy these on price, but when you get your items..please fully check them out.. a simple "does it work yes/no" is clearly not good enough, as i learned
