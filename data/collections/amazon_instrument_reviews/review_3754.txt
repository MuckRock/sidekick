I replaced the nasty, crooked, chipping plastic pins for these, and they work very well in keeping the strings where they should be.  I'm not convinced that they change the sound of my D-28 very much for better or worse.  I replaced one pin at a time and compared strings and really couldn't tell much of a difference, still they are better to handle and remove than the nasty plastic ones, so I consider them an upgrade.
