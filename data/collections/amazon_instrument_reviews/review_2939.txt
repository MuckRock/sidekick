I bought a Rogue mandolin from a friend (who bought from Amazon but did not have time to even play it) for only 25$, still brand new, never played.I have owned and played many other mandolins (about a dozen), this one is mainly for me to practice my mandolin setup skills. The mandolin is NOT playable in its brand new state (not in tune, action too high, lower action will result in string buzzes). And this is quite typical for a new mandolin without a proper setup. I went thru all the necessary steps (almost like a luthier would do) and it came out sweet. It now has very low action, no string buzz, very good intonation. One can find info about mandolin setup on the Web. It's quite tedious work.This will be my beater mandolin, at 25$, nothing can beat it.It stay in tune long enough for me to play one hour straight without having to re-tune. So this is more than adequate for daily practice. Often times, it even stay in tune the next days. I may consider replacing the tuner machines with better one. The finish on this model has some blemish (some small black spots on top the sunburst color), but only if you look really close, I would consider this as defects if the mando cost a few hundred, at less than 40$, no problem at all.Of course, this mandolin is no match for more expensive models/brands (such as Kentucky) but I gave it a 5 stars based on its high performance / cost ratio.If you don't know how to setup mandolin, then be prepared to pay 60$ to 80$ for a professional setup (which is a must, otherwise the mandolin is hard to play and does not play in tune). Some reviews gave this mandolin a bad rating due to this lack of knowledge (that's unfair). All brand new mandolins require setup (at this expense), unless the store did the setup and charge a higher price for it.If you are lucky to know someone who can setup for free, that would save you the cost of two mandolins like this !!!
