A bit more expensive then other strings,  But theire worth it,  the tone is outstanding,  They last a long time,  they never rally come out of tune..... and they do last 3x5times longer then any other string I've tryed.  The sustain is great they give a nice soth blusey thone, Not to dark not to bright Just perfect.These string's are worth it!
