I own a Fender '65 Reverb Reissue, and I had learned from many guitar gurus and such that the best tubes that sound amazing are very, very difficult to find. However, I bought this JJ Electronics one expecting something decent to tide me through until I had enough money to afford a higher-end tube, and this blew me away. I was surprised at how good the tone of the amp was and how it made my guitar sound.This was well worth the small amount of money that I paid for it. In fact, I think I will just go ahead and keep using this permanently until it's almost dead before I purchase another tube.
