Been playing for 30 years and I have used tube screamers extensively. As some of the other reviewers have noted this is basically a tube screamer clone without the annoying midrange hump which some people complain about.  It is reasonably quiet and is built with reasonably good components.  Most importantly it sounds quite good especially when you take into account that it cost a bit over 30 dollars. Are there better tube screamer clones out there? Probably but for the price you  will not find a better unit.  Build sturdy, I would gig with this without hesitation.I hate to leave this review because I know the prices will go up on the joyo stuff as more people are tuned into these products. Great pedal. Great value.
