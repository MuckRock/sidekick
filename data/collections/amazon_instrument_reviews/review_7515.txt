It's tough to shell $85+ for a pedal that is not an effect, but now that I've had it for a few weeks I'm glad I bought it. Although my guitars pretty much stay in tune, warmer weather and humidity levels affect my guitars and they change a little while I'm playing them. The Boss TU-3 is bright and easy to read and keeps me it tune all the time. When you play in a band, you got to have a pedal tuner and you can't go wrong with Boss.
