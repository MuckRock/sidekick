In my opinion...This is the best amp in this category. I know people who have the Marshall and the Fender. I plugged into my little HoneyTone and I had the best sounding micro amp hands down. They were both amazed with the sound. They said "well mine was only $45 and "mine was only $40." Too bad so sad for them. I told them mine was $20. Since it doesn't say Marshall or Fender, I only had to pay 1/2 for a better sounding amp. If you are looking for an amp with 1 or 2 watts, and know what to expect from a micro, this amp does not disappoint
