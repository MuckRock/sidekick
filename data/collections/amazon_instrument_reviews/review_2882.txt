I'm enjoying using this priced-right set of strings. I put these strings on my Martin guitar after receiving my new DVD from customerservice@peghead.nl entitled "How to Play Fingerstyle Guitar" by Eltjo Haselhoff, whose preview of this GREAT DVD I found on YouTube. See the preview and look at other Youtube videos of Eltjo - you'll want to order the DVD immediately.
