This little guy worked just as advertised. It's a tremendous tuner for gigging or practice when you forget your tuner or dont' feel like bringing it. It won't work the best for getting intonation right, but it hits regular tuning perfectly. Super easy to use and a must-have for anybody who gigs out.
