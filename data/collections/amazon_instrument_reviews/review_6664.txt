This switch goes with the Fender Blues Jr. III series of tube amps.  The connector is well hidden, it is up underneath the main badge on the back of the amp and you have to reach up underneath to find it.  These are single channel amps, the foot switch activates the Fat Switch, which gives a little extra boost to folks playing single coil pickups.  For an LP or other double coil the switch is almost overkill.  But this is the switch for that amp.
