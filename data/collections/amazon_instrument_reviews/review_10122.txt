Just barely gets the job done...I have a Fender Jazz Bass Standard.  The shape of the body of the guitar does not fit the arms of this stand and it forces you to position it very carefully to avoid the stand collapsing.  It is very low quality, not particularly sturdy and my cords get wrapped around it constantly.  Its JUST good enough, but if my room were larger and my guitar out in the open, I would be constantly worried about it falling over.  I will definitely be replacing this with a better quality stand in the near future.
