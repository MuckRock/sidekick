Just got it, so far so good. I use delay pretty light n tight - slapback vibe, not too wet. This does it well. I considered the MXR delay - no - I may have considered it but the only pedal failure I've ever experienced was my MXR/Dunlop Phase 90, first the DC input, then the stomp switch, after light/barely any bedroom use. This ModTone here, seems solidly constructed. I haven't played with it too much yet, but as of right now, I wouldn't recommend it for Edge wannabes, seems limited in that regard. I may be wrong, but either way, do we need more Edge wannabes?No, we do not.Good tone though, does the trick, trick.
