First of all, don't expect any new tuner to work as a "drop-in" replacement.  Drop-in replacements for tuners basically don't exist unless you have the exact type of tuner, and in that case, you aren't doing an "upgrade".  You'll likely need to bore out additional diameter for the peg hole with a drill press or tapered reamer.  Or, if there's a Guitar Center or guitar shop nearby, have a tech do the work for you.These tuners arrived quickly and are very attractive, with a nice vintage look.  They would look great on a either a Strat or Tele.  Unfortunately, my Squier Bullet had a slightly smaller headstock, which meant that the low E string's tuner was too large - the wing for the screw hung over the edge.  Therefore, I will not be installing these on my guitar, but that is not the fault of the tuner.Functionally, these are one of the easiest tuning keys to rotate, and I've heard the hold tune just fine.  Check the back of your headstock for fit, but if that's a "go", these are a great option!
