I bought this tuner mainly for my acoustic guitar; I have a Sabine tuner with a mini-mike but unplugging the tuner from my amp, having the room completely quiet and the tuner in a good position is a couple of extra steps I'd rather not go through.  This tuner is compact and works well; I clip it onto whatever guitar I pick up for a quick tune (acoustic OR electric), push the power button, and off I go.  I haven't fooled with the other features (Metronome? Detuning?), so I can't comment about them.  An added comment: I broke off one of the flimsy little tabs that holds onto the ball joint from it being overextended.  My fault, but it shouldn't have broken so easily.  I'm sure they could make the plastic tabs just a wee bit stronger/thicker, or make it so it pops out of the joint when overextended instead of breaking completely.
