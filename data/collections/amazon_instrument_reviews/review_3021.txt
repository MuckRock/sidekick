I had been having lots of trouble with my guitars falling from the leather ended straps.  Not any more.  These locking ends are the ticket!  They are quick to release and adjust, and fit very well.  They are bulky when putting the guitar in a case, but I just leave them on.  The strap itself is plain, but it highlights the beauty of my guitar.  It's a must for any rambunctious guitar player.
