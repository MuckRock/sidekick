Tested by the guitar mags to be the best strap lock available.  These are basically the same as Schaller strap locks.  They cost less money and I think the parts are interchangeable.  It is still best to keep them seperated as to their original manufacturer (disclaimer.)  I know that the Fender buttons will work in the Schaller strap portion of the lock.
