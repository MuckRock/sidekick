This issue with this bad boy is not quality, features, or design. This is a Pedaltrain product, and just like my Pedaltrain 2, this is a well-made, perfectly designed board that does exactly what it claims it will do -it holds 50 freaking pounds of guitar effects stuff. And that, my friends is the problem.I am using a Voodoo Labs 4x4 power supply, but had to also get a Tripplite Isobar, 6 outlet power strip that I drilled into the upper left corner to handle a couple of the extra pedals. I plug that into the wall and then use a homemade 8&#34; iec power plug in the Voodoo. On the pedal I was able to fit 2 Jim Dunlop volume pedals (one is for the looper), a Crybaby Wah, TC Electronic Flashback X4, Sparkbooster, Mojo mojo overdrive, Corona chorus, Hall of Fame Reverb, Ditto looper, and the Shaker vibrato. I also have the MXR flanger, Helicon Harmony pedal for vocals, a Korg tuner and an Electro Harmonix Pulsar tremolo.(I know, I know.)Did I mention this sucker is big? I feel like they should name it the &#34;pedal porch&#34;. Maybe I can put a few potted plants on it.So getting back to the question of whether or not you should get this behemoth, I will ask you, to ask yourself, &#34;Do I really need all these pedals? If the answer is &#34;Hell yes, I deserve them all! I worked hard for them and can now make awesome sounds!!&#34;, then by all means knock yourself out. Just don't get a hernia lugging it around and make sure you book venues with appropriate stage space. No joke.
