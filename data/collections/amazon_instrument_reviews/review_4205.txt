I own one of these amps and it is capable of everything from very clean to heavy over-drive. I love it. It's got tone galore! I play either a Martin A/E thru it or a Strat knock-off.  Either one sounds awesome.  Never dreamed of such an enjoyable little amp, let alone for $20. Battery life seems OK, but I hate messing with batteries, so I'd buy power supply (you can get a 9V supply (check for proper polarity) at the Thrift store for a buck).  Don't even think about it.  Get it.  $20 is pocket change.
