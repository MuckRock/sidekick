Not sure that title is good grammar, but anyway: I have gotten so much use out of my H2!  I'm a music teacher, and I have recorded music classes and performing groups.  Being able to so easily record a class and then have them listen to themselves has been really eye (and ear-) opening for those kids!It is very easy to use.  The various recording quality settings are useful, so you can do anything from a high quality record to a more space-saving mp3 setting.You can record stereo from just in front of the unit, or you can turn on 4-way, all-around recording.I've used mine a lot also just recording myself on various instruments.  I often record one part of a duet, then play along with it.You can do some editing on the unit, but it's easier to download the track and use some software to do it.  I have gone direct to disk, though, just by cutting off a little noise at beginning or end, which is some of the editing you can do on the H2.There is little to fault with it.  It takes a while to rename a track, for instance, but there again you could do it on your desktop after you download.Prior to this I had a Sony minidisc recorder, which was all right but really was already obsolete by the time I bought it. I finally got tired of messing with discs.I am very glad I got the H2.
