Moen pedals are great.  Nice quality at an unbelievable price point. This pedal is no exception.  It is a great sounding vibe with the bonus of a nice chorus which can be engaged by the toggle switch.  to be fair I have not tried many other vibes.  Hard to when most cost over twice the cost of this pedal.  That being said I am absolutely pleased with the sound of this pedal and have had no need to look elswhere.  vibe is very Trower like. Think bridge of signs.  Chorus is on the mellower side. Very analog sounding not digital.  Replaced my BBE mind bender and fits the bill so much better.  Solid well built and should last.  I would have no problem gigging with this and have with no issues.My only issue was that after a year or so the pedal seemed a bit less strong in its effect.  I read online that a bit of electrical tape around the internal led's would fix the problem and indeed it did.  It's been fine since.  Despite this needed fix I would buy this pedal again with no hesitation if I needed to
