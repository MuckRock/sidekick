This stand is probably one of the most popular among smaller bands, jammers and home studio owners because I run across them everywhere. And like everyone else I wound up with a few of my own. Here is what I have learned during the four or so years I have owned and used this model:- For the money they are a bargain and work extremely well in home studios and practice spaces (assuming the areas are not overly cramped.)- They hold up under light gigging and jamming, meaning they are not transported more than two or three days a week.- Good stability inside, even with heavier microphones like theBlue Microphones enCORE 100 Studio-Grade Dynamic Performance Microphone. Not so good outside if there is a fair breeze.I lost one to stepping inadvertently on one of feet, which immediately broke, and another has started binding when I try to extend or collapse the center pole. Those problems are not necessarily quality issues since in the case of the broken tripod it was my fault and not the gear's. As for the binding - I am sure that a good amount of grime has found its way into the tube after four years of use and transporting the stands. Had I taken better care of them those problems may have been prevented.For inexpensive stands these are hard to beat. However, I now use theSeismic Audio - Tripod Microphone Mic Boom Stand - PA/DJ/Band/Church/Wedding use, which I consider to be a superior stand for a small increase in price. Also, for outside use or when stage real estate is an issue I have found the old school styleOn Stage MC7201B Round Base Microphone Stand, Blackto be a far better solution.
