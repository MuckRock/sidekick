This is a very cheap little practice amp, and I hoped I'd be able to use it with the headphone port and aux in to practice without driving my GF nuts... Unfortunately I have a couple of problems:  the headphone and aux quality really wasn't that great (and using great phones).  The sound of the amp itself is dirty or dirtier... I just expected this to be a little more versatile than it turned out to be.For quiet practice, you're best getting a VOX Amplug, IMHO.  Sounds great, MUCH cheaper, and integrates external audio better.
