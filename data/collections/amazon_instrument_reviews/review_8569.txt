I wanted to add to my pedal arsenal, but I didn't have the big bucks to spend on a Tube Screamer. So, I took a chance on this little stomp-box from China.  It compares itself to the TS, right on the box, and for good reason.  They use the same chip. More importantly, the construction is solid, good looking, and takes up minimal pedal-board space.  The on-off switch seems a little chintzy, but the tone that comes out of this thing is awesome. I only found that out after replacing the dead battery that it comes with, and plugging in to a power supply (not provided with unit).  It turned my partscaster into a blues making machine. It's responds well to your technique, and you can make it so funky, you can smell it!  It truly does have true bypass, and logical controls.  I don't have A TS to make direct comparisons, but for the money, this little pedal gives me exactly the tone I want.  And I saved about 70 or 80 bucks.  Ba-Da Bing!
