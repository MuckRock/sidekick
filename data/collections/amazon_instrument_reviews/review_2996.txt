I typically use dimarzio cliplocks on all my basses and electric guitars. they work very well for my needs.  however, I bought a junker bass for outdoor gigs and to play at places where i don't care what happens to the gear.  This strap is perfect for those needs. A nice nylon and the lock works wellBUTthe locking portion might be a little thick for some strap buttons. It works on the bass i use it on, but not my Gibson SG, so be aware. I would buy more of these if i needed a cheap strap.
