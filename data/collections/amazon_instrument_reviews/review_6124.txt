I use this as the first pedal that my guitar cable touches as it goes into the pedal board. It's true bypass, which means that the sound is not affected when it's not in use. When you step on the button, the sound cuts out and you get the tuner. It works as advertised. My only complaint is that it could be smaller. There are other smaller true-bypass tuners out there if space is an issue on your board. I've posted a photo of this tuner on my board -Pedaltrain MINI With Soft Case. If you need a smaller tuner, I have buddies who use and like the polytune.
