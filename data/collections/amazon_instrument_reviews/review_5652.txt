I always keep a lot of these on hand. These are the only picks I use when playing my acoustic guitars (strumming style & vocals). Since I play for several hours nearly every day I have a tendency to go through a lot of picks. These definitely last longer for me than other brands (similar weight) that I have used. For example, I can &#34;round-off&#34; the end off a Musician's Gear pick or a Fender pick in about an hour or so of playing and seem to get much more mileage out of these picks. The weight is great for my style of playing. They seem more durable than other brands. They're inexpensive and since I play a lot of hours I always keep lots of these on hand. I love 'em, use them daily, and rely on them !!!
