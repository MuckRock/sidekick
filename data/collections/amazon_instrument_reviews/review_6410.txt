I have not tested other micro amps, this does for what I bought it for, to practice at home or anywhere without disturbing and easy transport, it's very portable to take with you. I really like the overdrive sound, the tuner works really well, I dont like much the clean channel it breaks up fast to a not so clean channel, but overall its a great product, so if you need a good tone, and a very portable micro amp you can give this one a try, it's great.
