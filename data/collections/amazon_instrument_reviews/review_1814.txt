I love this company. D'addario makes a grab product and it lasts a long time. Ever since I switched to this brand of strings, they seem to last longer and make a grab tone. I don't know if it's my guitar (Taylor 214CE) or the strings, but I can not get over how great the quality is even after months of use. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who plays the acoustic guitar.
