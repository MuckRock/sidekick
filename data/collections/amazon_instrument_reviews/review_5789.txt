I bought this used off a friend when I got my first Electric.  It's a great little practice amp that is plenty loud enough for a small room.  The destortion works well enough.  Bass and treble are adjustable and seem just fine.  Input jack has held up real well so far (amp is about 4 years old now)and the speaker is pretty clean.  My only problem is that the volume just does not go low enough.  I can't practice while everyone else is in the room watching tv.  I suppose a set of headphones would solve this problem- but then its something else I gotta plug in and worry about.  I find that I like the sound of the overdrive better (especially thru my Epi LP) but just can't play it low enough.  I end up having to turn the overdrive off, and then turning the amp up loud and turning the guitar down real low.  If you have issues with volume control in your house- then make sure to get a set of headphones- or else you could suffer the dirty looks, and the banishment I have suffered.  All in all a real nice practice amp at a good price point.
