I use to use a cloth to clean my strings... this now rests in my guitar tech bag as a very useful tool.Easy to open, clamp on the strings, run it up and down and your strings maintain a clean and clear sound longer! The only thing that I worry about is running the plastic over the frets. I understand that it's only plastic, but I wonder if it will decrease the life of the frets over time...I don't know... if I see an issue, I may update this a year or so down the line.Until then? Excellent solution!
