I am not a studio engineer, nor am I a professional musician.  I record songs in my home as a hobby.  I like to have reasonably nice gear in order to get as good a sound as possible in that setting, so if you're at or around the same level, you know what I'm talking about.  Will this compare to a mic that costs three times as much?  No.  Are you likely to find it in a high-end professional studio?  Eh...probably not.  Is it a pretty sweet deal at this price point?  Hells yes.I've worked my way up in terms of mic quality as my hobby has gotten progressively more serious, and this is the nicest mic I own right now.  The difference in quality between this and even a nice dynamic mic is immediately obvious.  I use it for recording vocals, and my voice (again, not a pro!) is finicky to record, usually sounding pretty muddy.  Even with nicer dynamic mics usually used for vocals (SM57 and 58) this was still the case.  But with this mic, my voice sounds much more clear and open.Admittedly, this is a very subjective evaluation, but then aren't all mic evaluations subjective?  You can go on all day about response range and EQ flatness, but what matters in the end is how the mic sounds in your application.  And to my ears, this mic sounds wonderful.My only real gripe is that the sensitivity pattern doesn't seem to be a super-tight cardioid, because it still picks up some sound coming from behind it.  Perhaps this is how it's supposed to be, but when trying to record both vocals and a loud electric guitar simultaneously, it can be a headache trying to jury-rig an isolation method that works.  I took off a star for this alone, although that may not be fair since I haven't used any other large-diaphragm condensers and therefore have no idea if they're all supposed to behave this way.
