Every Guitarist needs a good tuner! and everyone knows Boss makes some of the best products. The fact is tho I really cant afford to spend 90-100usd for a tuner! When I received this unit I decided first thing I was going to do was to compare it to my other hand held chromatic tuners. They all work the same. Using this pedal I am able to obtain the same results, that's good enough for me. Activating the tuner takes a little over 2-3 seconds, but that's fine since I usually tune within breaks and you hardly need to tune especially when you have a good guitar/tuning pegs.
