If it's good enough to track Tom Petty's vox on the heartbreakers albums, its good enough for the rest of us. Sounds great on amps and perc. Dropped one from a 12 story building a few years back into a parking lot and it barley dented the housing and still works 100%. My drummer still uses it on his kit and I never told him haha (hope he doesn't read this review!) It's a shame the new mics coming out (wireless stuff they make: IE Presentor, PG seies, digital series etc) are such flimsy pieces of garbage. This is the last of the cool from Shure.
