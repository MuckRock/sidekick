It's really not a 200w system.  The booklet even says it is only 100 watts, and I doubt it is really even that powerful.  The wireless microphone only works when you put your mouth about an inch from it.  My Shure XLR wired microphones do not work with it even with an adapter plug.  The instrument input works OK with my Taylor guitar, but it's not 100 watts loud.  I guess it's OK as a portable guitar amp in a small venue without any vocals.
