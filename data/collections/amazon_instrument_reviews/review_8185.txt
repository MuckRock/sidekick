I like many things about this tuner. The fact that it turns off quicker than most and you only have to press the button to turn it off. Unlike the Fender which you have to press and hold. May not sound like a big deal but if you need to change tune in the middle of a show this one's faster. The Fender tuner in my opinion, and for my needs is more accurate and easier to see due to the fact that it gives a nice green color once you tune up. But this one's cheaper. Ahh decisions decisions. Still, you can't go wrong either way.
