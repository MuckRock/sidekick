I was pleasantly surprised at how well this little mixer performs. It was exactly what I needed to record myself singing karaoke on the computer. For the price it does a very good job. I don't detect any hum at all and I only get hiss when I crank the volume up too high. I recommend this mixer for your home studio. It works perfectly with my sound card. You do NOT need USB to get this to work.
