This is a great guitar for the money. I paid $69.34 for my guitar and bought it through Amazon.com from Streamline Audio Video. It arrived ahead of schedule in great shape, ready to play right out of the box (after tuning it of course). If you want a better guitar than this, you will need to spend a whole lot more. The sound is great and it is easy to play. Only about 41&#34; long and may weigh a bit over the 6 lbs. stated in the description. My strings arrived is fine condition and the action was very close to what I will need.
