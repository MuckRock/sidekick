If you want to increase the amount of gain and distortion in your tube amp, drop one of these in the V1 position (the tube closest to the input jack of your amplifier).  Easy to do, and you'll notice an immediate increase in distortion.Placed one in a Fender Blues Junior.  Before when the master was down and the pre-amp/volume was all the way up, I could barely get some overdrive.  Afterwards, it had plenty.  Night and Day difference.Good sound too... Not harsh, adds harmonics.  Very lush sounding.  Tung Sol knows how to do it.
