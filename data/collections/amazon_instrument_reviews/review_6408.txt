I ordered this after I saw one on a squier bass at a local shop. The plate looks great on my MIM fender Telecaster and it is thicker and nicer than the Fender 'F' plate I see on other guitars. I used the screws and it was an easy install. Other reviewers have posted about the finish and thickness of the plate. The plate has five screw holes, but doesn't look bad using 4.This is just a visual mod for me mainly to get rid of the crappy cheap plate which is used on my MIM Telecaster.
