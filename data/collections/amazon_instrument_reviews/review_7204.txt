Very authentic sound reproduction. Simple to install but be aware that the instructions are not very clear. The threaded end is 'holed' so you can hook it with a wire to pull it into position on the tailstock. You'll never get your arm in there far enough. LOLYou will need a 15/32nd drill bit to complete the install.
