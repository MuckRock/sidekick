For the price you will expect what sound you'll get, I haven't tried other expensive ones, but I have a Yamaha NTX700 with built in pickups (Pro guitar) and the price reflects the quality.Also the WCP-60G has no guide or manual where to attache it to get the best soundIt is not that expensive, you can buy it if you just want the sound of the guitar to be recorded
