I got these because I hate changing strings on a floating tremolo any more than I absolutely have to.... at first I thought I may have made a mistake because the tone was all off (super bright sounding on first installation).... played for a half hour and retuned, sounded better. Played for another half hour and retuned, sounded even better. Played for another few hours and they sound fantastic. Will update after I get a hundred hours on them (about 50 days from now). Will say that they handle bends very well and dive bombing deep on the trem hasn't hurt them yet.... VERY IMPRESSED
