I'm on the fence with this product. It does its job so no real complaints there, however once applied I feel it may be damaging my frets. I havent seen wear or visible damage but as you run it up the neck of the guitar you hear it hit all the frets. If you apply pressure to keep it from hitting it then pulls the top cleaning pad off, away from the strings causing it not to clean the top. Much more convenient then using a string cleaning cloth though so I'm sticking with this.
