The ebow is a crazy concept. It's fun to use and also very challenging. It comes with a book that had many variations on how to use it, which was nice. Comes with a velvet pouch and dvd. It's a little pricey now I assume from supply and demand but if you've got the extra cash and play every day, pick this up. Also, I played in a band and we did Miserlou and the other guitar player played the trumpet part with an ebow. I don't know how he did it or what setting his amp was on, but it sound like there was a TRUMPET in the room. He clearly, was good with an ebow. Goes to show how diverse they are.
