I own several Taylor acoustics, and a few other kinds of guitars. I bought the original pack of these from a suggestion of a friend who had a few acoustics damaged by humidity (too dry). These are so easy to use, and can be &#34;recharged&#34; if you feel like $12-15 for 3 is too much every couple of months. I've successfully recharged these using distilled water about 3 times now, and they work just as great as they did new. These also come in a resealable package, so you can recharge them and then store them until you need to replace the other set in guitar case.You can tell when they've dried out by the fact they get crunchy feeling. It means they need to be replaced.To recharge them, I take a large ziplock plastic container with a lid (big enough to hold 1 quart), and then pour a few cups of distilled water in the bottom. Next, I take a smaller empty ziplock container (the bottom of one big enough to hold a sandwich), and float it on the water in the larger container. Then place the 3 packs in the floating container (stacked on one another or on their sides) and seal the top of the larger container with a lid. It traps the humidity in the container, and the membrane on these packs is two-way, so they absorb it until they reach capacity again.
