A couple inches behind my bridge is where it lives and I've never had cause to remove it. At first I thought I'd hate the look of it there, but it's never bothered me one bit. Reaching for pics is never a problem. I just wish there was a size that worked well with jazz III pics. This one works with regular size pics and to fit the jazz II I have to add a regular pic in there first then put a jazz III in it works out so not too much a big deal.
