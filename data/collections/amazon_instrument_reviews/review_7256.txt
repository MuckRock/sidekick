Nice thumbpicks for banjo. They are size large, so if you generally have a very large hand they will be tight on you. I have a larger hand and they work well, but they are about a micrometer away from being too snug. But I like them a lot. Would also work fine with acoustic guitar picking if that's whay you're into (though I always preferred acoustic picking without a thumbpick).
