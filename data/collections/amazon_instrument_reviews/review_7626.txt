I picked up a couple of these straps, one for a Les Paul and one for a bass.  Anyone who's ever played a Les knows that a wide comfortable strap is a must-have.  This one fits the bill.  The end-pieces are thick, with a peg-hole that just fits--not so small you have to cut and not so large you're worried about the guitar slipping out.  The cotton strap itself is pliable and comfortable.  It doesn't scratch like the plastic straps do and it doesn't grab your shirt so badly.  Can't complain.  Good strap at a good price.
