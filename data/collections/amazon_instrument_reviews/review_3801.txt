I got this mic to record a vocal podcast and so far I'm very happy with the results.  The sound quality is wonderful, the sensitivity is amazing!  Clarity is great, packaging is nice with the carry case and included stabilizer.  I'm not an audio expert, but so far the sound quality out of this mic sounds very excellent to me.
