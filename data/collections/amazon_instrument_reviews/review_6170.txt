This is a great analog delay, analog meaning you're not gonna get a lot of crazy sounds and delays that last forever. If you're looking to get creative with lots of weird sounds, get the Boss Digital Delay. This pedal is intended to just color your tone a little bit and it does so in a spectacular way. I'm very pleased with it.
