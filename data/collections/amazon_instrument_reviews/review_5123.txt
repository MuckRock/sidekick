I just can't believe how loud this little baby is. I also have a 180watts Behringer keyboard amp (4 inputs, with lot of FX) but it's a littl heavy to move around.This little amp does everything I need for small gathering. I tried everything as soon as I received it:1) guitar (classic), mandolin, acoustic guitar all sound the way they normally sound in this ampActually, the classical guitar sounds much better and this encourage me to play more thru this amp.2) the microphone, although no reverb or echo, is good enough for singing, sounds as the true voice of the singer3) the MP3 input is 1/4", which I prefer over the little 1/8", volume must be controlled by the MP3 player itself4) guitar and mic have separate volume control (we really need it).In summary, it's ready to be used right out of the box.It only weights 15 lbs so moving around is really easy.
