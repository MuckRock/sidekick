The snark makes tuning your guitar easier and faster than anything I've ever seen.  It does wonders for tuning your guitar and cuts down on the time to tune your guitar. The music stores can't seem to keep these in stock because they are so popular. The price in the stores is $20.00 and at Amazon, you can get it for half the price. I saw no difficulties with using the tuner and it was up and running on the guitar and is easy to use.
