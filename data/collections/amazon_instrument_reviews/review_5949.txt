I love this pedal! That said I would like to address some of the reviews I see on here. I have been playing guitar since I was 14 years old. I am now 57 so I have a few years of experience. First you guys who complain about the plastic housing. Are you jumping up and down on your effects pedals? If you are stop doing it. All you have to do is gently step on the switch and it works. The plastic housing is extremely strong and won't bust when used properly. The next thing I would like to address is the battery running down &#34;even when it's turned off&#34;. Every effects pedal I ever owned would run the battery down if you leave your guitar plugged in when not playing it. Get a one spot adapter and a daisy chain. It will save you a fortune. The ones saying the sound sucked, buy something besides a $50 amp, and learn where to put the chorus in the pedal chain. Thi is a good pedal and I've used it on stage for 2 years without a problem. That means I have spent about $11 a year for a pedal that has earned me Thousands! Buy one, learn how to use it and you'll be happy.
