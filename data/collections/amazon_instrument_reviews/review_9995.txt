D'Addario strings are like the Kias of the string world. They make cheap products that cost a lot less but last a lot less time. These strings are OK...I've always been partial to Nickel wound (particularly semi-flatwound, but I digress). My typical strings are Elixirs, so I'm used to them lasting a long time. In this case, the strings sound good...like most nickel strings do. But they didn't last long at all before they started sounding dull and lifeless, and stopped keeping intonation accurately. So, like most D'Addario strings. So...they're not bad, but don't expect them to last like Elixirs do. You get what you pay for.
