I bought 5 of these for live recording of my band. They adjust easil for most any amplifier height yet stable enough for on stage recoding. I recomend these for anyone that needs a low cost means to place mics on a live stage. Features: Stable base; good extension; easy hand grip to lock/unlock for adjusting. For me it was a good perchase.
