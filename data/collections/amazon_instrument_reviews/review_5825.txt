This thing is amazing. Like many I cannot afford a tube amp. This transforms my solid state amps into something very comparable to the tube amps I played years ago. Sustain and harmonics are insane. Preamp is very precise and allows for a nice variety of tones.The unit is very heavy and rugged. The only component I would be concerned with over time is the battery adapter but this is replaceable at low cost.
