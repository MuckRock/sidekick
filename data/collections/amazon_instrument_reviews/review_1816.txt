I love these customs...inbetween the lights and mediums...you get the bright booming sound...nice bends and of course, the longer playing life...I've used these on my guitars that have alittle darker sound because of the wood used in them...to brigthen the sound a tad.  I would recommend these for cedar or mahagony body guitars in a blink of an eye.
