I buy Elixirs with all my acoustic guitars now. They last the longest and hold the brightest and clearest tone of any string I've ever used. The nanoweb coating really does make a huge difference. They take several months to wear out (as opposed to the weeks other major brands last). They may cost a bit more than the competition, but if you try them and love them as much as I do, you'll never use anything else again.
