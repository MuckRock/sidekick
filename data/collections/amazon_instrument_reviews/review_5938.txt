I recently received my multi plug cable (daisy chain) for use with my guitar pedals and I am very pleased with one spots, product. I can tell it is a built to last cable with eight plugs spaced out enough to allow me to put my pedals where I like them. It plugged into my Behringer 9 volt power adapter nicely. Its so nice to not to have to replace 9 volt batteries every week. A real money saver in the long run. Buy this cable.
