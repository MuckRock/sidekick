Bought this to tune my hammered dulcimer. The clip is a bit larger than I expected, but it just fits on to the bridges under the strings. If I had paid more attention to the picture on the site I would have known how large the clip is in relation to the 1/4" plug.It does it's job, picking up vibrations from the instrument rather than noise from the room. Works well while other things are going on around you. It seems to track 'truer' with this clip than with the internal microphone, meaning it doesn't bob up and down as much. If that holds true for other instruments, I may start using this clip on everything.I saw one review mention that the clip they received was not labeled Korg. The one I got is labeled, both on the package and on the clip.
