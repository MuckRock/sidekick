Not too light and bendy, not too heavy and stiff, these picks are just right. Dunlop also makes quality picks, and I have yet to break one of these. They last a long time. I am a guy so at first I wished they weren't purple, but since Dunlop only codes their sizes with certain colors I like them so much I don't really care what color they are anymore. I bought a pack of these picks for much less money at my local music store so I would recommend looking there first. Now please stop cutting up milk jugs and go buy these. Now!
