I have another headstock tuner that I've had for awhile.  This Planet Waves PW is about the half the size and works just as well.  The clamp that holds the tuner to the headstock is a little flaky, but the tuner works like a champ.  Nicely backlite for those low lighting conditions.  Compared to my other tuner, it's rigt on the money.  The other plus is that since it small and my guitar case has a little wiggle room, I don't have to take the tuner off.
