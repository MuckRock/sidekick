This is a good product which I've seen many people use... however, it's not for all acoustic guitars.  That little bit of info was missing from the info, although I should have known.  In my case, my guitar's sound hole is too small for this unit to be installed, even though it's supposedly &#34;tapered&#34; to fit a lot of different sound hole dimensions.  Didn't look tapered to me, and I can't use it.  But then again, it was pretty cheap, and I may have a use for it some day.  Check your guitar's sound hole diameter before ordering.
