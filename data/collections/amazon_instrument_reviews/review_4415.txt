I've had it for about a month now and it hasn't fallen apart so I guess that's a plus, but the main issue with this rackmount is that whatever automated machine they used to drill the screw holes is definitely defective, as a large majority of the holes are slightly deformed and will not take in the provided screws and are therefore USELESS.  Thanks to this problem I am only able to use TWO slots out of TWELVE.  It's definitely very frustrating and although the price is tempting, stay away from this.
