It is well made and is very safe unless a drunk drummer knocks over your stand. I would prefer more tilt, but it serves the purpose. It's Also harder to use your iPad without holding it and having an arm rest. Very durable and light weight. If I had to do it over again, I would use a music stand instead. Someday I may use it on stage. It's made in Germany, so it could be taken into battle.
