I am not a fussy person about guitar strings.  They either sound good or they don't to you and you are the one that matters.  I was very pleased with getting 3 sets at this price delivered to my front door.  There are so many different strings out there just go with the flow and look at the company logo on the outside.  Martin is at the top of the heap.  These strings sound light and bright. Very pleased with this purchase.
