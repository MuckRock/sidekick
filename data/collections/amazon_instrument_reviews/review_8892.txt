This tuner is super easy to use and very user friendly. Clamp it on, press the power switch, and then  pluck a string. It will tell you if you are hitting the right note and if it is in tune.I only gave this 3 stars because the battery meter only indicated 1/2 charge out of the box. It still had the plastic barrier that had to be removed to connect the battery.  Shouldn't it have a full battery since it is brand new? Not enough of a hassle to send it back, but worth mentioning.Had the battery not been an issue, I would have rated this 5 stars.
