ever since I saw a vid with mark tremonti where he says that he heard a lot of musicians used Jazz 3 picks, and after having tried them that he simply couldn't use an other pick.. I decided to try them out.. and I fell instantly in love with the regular jazz III picks!I always had issues holding picks and keeping them &#34;put&#34; while i played and the jazz III was no exception so it didn't bother me..Meaning I didn't really feel like there was a problem other than me, being that problem... Then I read about this new Ultex thingyit looked like a jazz III and every one seemed to like it..sooo I figured why not have a go at it... I was skeptical about this &#34;impossible to drop&#34; thing which I read..so i was dieing to feel them... Well they came.. i tried them and after playing for a while I didn't even notice that I hadn't once readjusted my pick..... NOT ONCE ... it was like there was no pick.. i started paying closer attn and more and more i realized that this thing really is what its hyped up to be... it stays there... to me that's just freaking incredible! holy @#$@%# wow! I love this thing love it love it!
