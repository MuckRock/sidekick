These Fender string guides are replacing the old style string guide(tree). Installed on a Tele I built. Much less surface of the string touching. Very smooth action when using the vibrato. Took no more than 10 minutes to install.. Reasonably priced, super upgrade. I recommend this product to anyone with string guides on their guitar. These look like rollers, but are not rollers. They do work well. and I will purchase more for other Tele's and StratsPros: Well made  Cons; None I can think ofSleek, well designedQuick installImproved soundInexpensive upgrade
