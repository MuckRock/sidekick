Five stars because it works on my Digitech GNX guitar processor which requires 9 volts and about 75 Milli-amps. This has an output of 300 Milli-amps. For electronics the voltage has to be correct. But an appliance will only draw as many amps (current) as it needs. So this adapter is coasting when used with the guitar processor and can be used with other devices that draw up to the 300 Mamps. Just be sure your (9v) device doesn't require more than the 300 Ma this can deliver. But it's a power adapter, I cannot be in love with a power adapter.
