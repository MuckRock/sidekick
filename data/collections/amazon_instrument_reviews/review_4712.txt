At this price range, this little effects pedal does admirably. You can get pretty decent sound out of this. No need to spend a lot, especially if your'e on a budget this is pretty good. I took off one star because the tone is sort of weird sounding in high-gain situations. Other than that I've had no problems. Holding up well.
