I've been using these for about 3 weeks now - they are strong but flexible and don't seem to develop kinks or bending "habits" if you roll them up the proper way.I've seen and used some better cables but not at this price point.  And I've certainly seen quite a few worse!  This is a pretty good sweet spot, in my opinion.
