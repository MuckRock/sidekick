I write and record my own music.  When I upgraded to a new computer with Windows 8 it wouldn't support my M-Audio Fast Track Pro so I had to upgrade.  The Focusrite Scarlett worked right out of the box.  I replaced the stock cable with a Monster cable and my recordings sound great.  Very easy to use.  Just plug in a microphone or guitar, set your levels, and start rocking.
