I bought one of these used that was just like new when I got it.  The craftsmanship is amazing as is the sound quality of this little ukulele.  The build quality, the Aquila strings, and the tuning keys are very high quality.  You can sound great with one of these little instruments in no time.  I downloaded a Lanikai booklet off the internet and was on my way.  It is pure fun to play one of these ukuleles.I bought this for my granddaughter and would suggest a larger model for any adult with larger fingers. Some of the chords are hard to form due to the small size of the frets.  I am still stoked at playing this until my granddaughter takes over on this one.
