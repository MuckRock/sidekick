This is a great capo from shubb. The finish matches most guitar hardware as it is nickel. I like how it works. It adjusts to fit different guitar necks, and just sort of snaps in place. It doesn't require great force or a lot of hand strength to use this capo. The rubber parts are replaceable and with a name like shubb you know you're getting a good product. I recommend this capo to anyone.
