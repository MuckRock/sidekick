I had changed my strings with some new Martins I got recently. They were bloody awful! Luckily, I'd also picked up a package of these Ernie Ball strings. First of all, they were packaged better than the Martins, they went on more easily and after I tuned up, they sound SO much better! Thank you Ernie Ball, for making far superior strings. My guitar thanks you as well (grin).
