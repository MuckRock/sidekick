I bought this sustain pedal for my iRig Keys Midi Controller, I had an On Stage pedal (square), but that was crap. This M-Audio is awesome, it doesn't move from where I put it on the floor, it sustains the note how it supossed to, and it feels very well. So far it's still working, and it has a switch button to use with any keyboard. I would buy it again!!
