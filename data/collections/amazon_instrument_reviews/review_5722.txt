If you are using Electro-Harmonix, Red Witch, Voodoo Labs or the larger MXR pedals, they won't fit in the styrofoam cutouts. You can, though, just take that styrofoam pad out and velcro the effects on to the board.I also have a Morley wah and they have big footprints, so they will take up a good initial chunk of room on the board. If you have a Cry Baby, though, everything should fit a little more comfortably. Right now, I have the Morley sitting outside the board due to the number of pedals I own and that four of them are a little outsized (MXR ten band EQ, EHX Electric Mistress, Seymour Duncan Tweak Fuzz).There is some hum, but it isn't so pronounced that it interferes that much with your sound.So for all that you get with this and the fact that it cuts down almost totally on the need for adapters (except a DOD Malmsteen preamp overdrive), this is a great deal. Of course, the durability is still in question at this point.
