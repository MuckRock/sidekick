I got this by mistake, confusing it with the tremolo effect. But, either way, I liked it and decided to keep it. It's a really good deal at the price. And it sounds just as good as major brands. The only problem most people find is the material that it's made of. It's like a hard plastic, not metal like most are. But, if you're not a person who abuses your gear, it should last you a good while.I cannot use it for recording, because there is some hiss from it, like all other Behringer pedals, and I record direct, not through amp. But, for live playing, it's great. It's especially perfect for garage and bar bands.
