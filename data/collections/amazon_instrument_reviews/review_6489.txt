The case is very nice and sturdy. It has lasted over a year and will last for more years to come. The inside is very nice and soft with a big pocket to put things in it like picks, tuners, capos. It also has a lock on the case in case one might need it. This is a very good price for a case of this good of quality and I highly recommend it.
