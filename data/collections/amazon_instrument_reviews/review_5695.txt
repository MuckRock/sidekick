I mix and master all my own music on these guys. Before the audiophiles try to stone me to death, listen! I cant have giant KRK monitors blasting in my small apartment, but what I can have is a solid pair of affordable headphones that present my music in a very true light. These are not Beats by Dre, they will not make all your songs have super bass, and they aren't a great fashion statement; however, they ARE work horses and will show you how your music REALLY sounds. Nicer headphones exist, true, but these are the best in their price range in my opinion.
