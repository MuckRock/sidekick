Used on my acoustic guitar.Pro:Removes friction for faster playing. I noticed immediate result after applying first time.Enhances string life and tone. Strings sound brighter now. I guess there was some mild crud buildup you can't see.Reduces finger noise. Not completely gone but lessened.Easy to use applicator. Wide applicator makes it easy to put on and not get it onto the fret board.Con:Packaged in a metal tin and the applicator went dry after 3 weeks. Has no seal and the little cap on the applicator doesn't prevent dry out.I don't believe I would buy again until a sealed container is provided.
