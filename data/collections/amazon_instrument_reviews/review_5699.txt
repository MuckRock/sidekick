As background, I've recorded many jazz performances and listen normally to electrostatic speakers and have a pair of electrostatic headphones as well as dynamic models.These Audio Technica headphones are closed back isolating headphones which greatly reduce background noise. That said they are more difficult to design well as the closed ear cups and back create acoustic interaction with the back of the drivers. These headphones have a very open sound, smooth midrange, excellent detail with out exaggerated treble and very solid, and perhaps a bit emphasized bass.They are extremely comfortable, well made and easy to store. Finally the pricing of these fine headphones are not over inflated as are many high quality products. Highly recommended.
