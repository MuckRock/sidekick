Despite an overwhelming petroleum smell coming out of the box, this is a high-quality gig bag with plenty of storage space. Fits either a Tele or Strat. I don't typically keep my guitars in their cases, but bags like this one come in handy for gigs, short trips, moves, etc. Nice styling touches, too. The bag has removable back-straps for carrying ease.
