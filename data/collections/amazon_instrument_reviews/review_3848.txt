I'm happy with this.  Used it to replace the blown speaker from a 30 yr. old 60W Roland Cube Amp (a bass player used the amp and I think it was too much for the speaker -- next time I'll use the PA for the bass player).  Much better sound, perfect fit, etc. Keep in mind this is for a very clean sound and this speaker was recommended for its clean and somewhat smokey-type sound.  I believe it has those.  Using this for jazz applications and having the Roland around as a second amp.
