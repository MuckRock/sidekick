I love these strings. I'm a novice and have been using the strings that came with base which were roundwound strings. I don't like the sound my fingers make when moving between notes. With these flats, the sound is gone. What more, the sound of these strings is a lot more bold and has some awesome tone. It's easy to tell what strings are for notes, but just in case you have a hard time telling thickness for some reason, they are color coded to help with that. I can't speak out about other types of strings, but I love these over roundwounds in both how they play and the sound. I will experiment with other flats over time, but I am very happy with these.
