This is super warm and can get very trippy.  I like the depth it adds to everything from subtle, extreme and whatever else, the mod switch is great for the flutter effect too, nice extra.  600 milliseconds really is more than enough and I have a highend tape type unit that is something like 2.5 seconds but for what this does, more than enough.  I like retro and this is it, I used this on a show the day I got it and it was noticed by all.  I have to say MXR has really stepped up their stuff, very musical pedal.  Again, do your Youtube homework and listen around and you'll come to your conclusion.  Amazon is great to deal with.
