It claims to stop &#34;string talk,&#34; when you rub fingers on wound strings. It doesn't. But it does reduce it somewhat, and it also helps me keep playing even when my fingers get sore from playing too long, or playing a new song over and over.I gather my fretting fingers together and spray a little bit of this stuff right onto my fingertips. Seems to help my callouses without messing them up, and reduces the tenderness under the callouses that comes after a lot of playing.
