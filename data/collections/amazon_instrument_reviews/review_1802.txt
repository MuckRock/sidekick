But unless you are new to guitar, you know that. These strings are more expensive because they are supposed to last longer. Really, I can't tell that they do. Or that they don't. They sound great, and play great and I usually purchase D'Addario or Martin strings. Not sure if I would pay more for these in future, I play an average of daily to every other day depending on what gets in the way.  Change the strings every couple of months. Just me at home so no big deal, if I were performing I would go through them faster.I'm giving 5 stars because D'addario makes great strings. 'Nuff said.
