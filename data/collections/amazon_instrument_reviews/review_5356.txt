I installed these on my 2000-ish Epiphone Les Paul.  They provide a VERY noticeable upgrade and provide a true vintage look.  I can tune with much finer precision, and they hold that tuning with even the nastiest of bending.  The ability to accurately tune and keep that tuning allows to play and sound better.  I should note that I had to drill new holes or, more precisely, enlarge the holes on my guitar.  I used a 3/8 drill bit and just went very slowly and carefully.  I'm sure the idea of drilling your guitar might sound scary, but it was actually quite easy.  Now they are in there nice and snug since I made the holes a bit tight.
