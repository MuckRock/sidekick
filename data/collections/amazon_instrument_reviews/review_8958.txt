This is such a cute little instrument, my daughter loves it and the sound is good.  The only downside is that it doesn't stay tuned for very long.  We always have to go and re-tune it, which can be frustrating.  But otherwise it seems well made, it looks great and when its tunes, the sound is good.  Its not multi-hundred dollar instrument, but for kids and beginners its a good deal.
