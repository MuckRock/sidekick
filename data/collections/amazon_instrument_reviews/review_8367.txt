UPDATE: 15 July 2013I still really love how these assist in quick tuning, but MAN, are they FLIMSY.All of my other musician friends- who also LOVE this tuner's ability to grab the right pitch- also have employed copious amounts of super glue to re-attach the neck and clip to the body of the tuner.So, in short, this is a mixed bag. I would rate the abilities of the actual tuner at somewhere over 6 stars- EASILY my favorite ever in this capacity... combined with the absolutely DEPLORABLE build quality of the clip itself.Sigh.It's such a bummer to rave about a product to your friends... only to follow it with the obligatory disclaimer.If SNARK fixes the problem, I would instantly bring the rating back up to my original 5 star rating... but until then...and I LOVE this tuner... 2.5 stars, rounded up to 3.Boo.(ORIGINAL REVIEW)I have had similar tuners in the past... and by similar, I mean clip on...Nearly every other tuner I have had has not maintained a reading, which translated into what felt like a game of keep away, where I was the frustrated kid in the middle who could never quite catch the pitch.I am willing to bet that lots of folks have had this experience with many tuners. Not only that, but many of these tuners run upwards of twenty bucks, if not more.So I was skeptical. But so many high reviews couldn't be wrong, and for the price I figured it was a fairly risk free gamble.Really glad I tried it out!The screen is clear and easy to read, and the pitch indicator holds steady in one spot. No more chasing pitch for me!Haven't needed to use the vibration/ mic option yet, but I am sure that will come in handy at some point.Planning on getting another one for my other instruments as well.Definitely recommended!
