This MXL Studio 24 USB Microphone is a decent choice for those needing a portable or a good quality studio microphone. We professionally produce instructional videos, both at our shop and at customer locations, and often need to voice over footage. This mic will replace theBlue Microphones Snowball USB Microphone (Textured White)we use in studio and also theMXL Mics MXL-STUDIO 1 USB Condenser Microphone, Cardioidwe had previously used for off-site recording.Pros -* Good Voice Quality; cleanly captures spoken voices* Good Physical Quality; this is beefy mic that feels very well made* Looks Professional; while not important to the functionality, it makes a good impression on our customers* Long USB Cord; allows for placement away from PC* Headphone Jack; "real time monitor", handy to listen to live recording and playback* Travels Well; includes a protective travel case that fits all of componentsCons -* No Pop-Filter Included; normally I wouldn't mention this but the instructions include a warning the condenser mics are susceptible to water damage (like from breath moisture) and a pop-filter is "essential". We boughtNady MPF-6 6-Inch Clamp On Microphone Pop Filter* Left Channel; only brings in audio on the left channel, had to compensate in my editing softwareMisc -* Since we do not do music recording of any type, I can't comment on the mic's performance in that area* Software; Studio Control GUI (downloadable) can be launched to control some of the finer functions of the microphone, but the interface is not intuitive and my editing software (Sony Vegas Pro) gives me better control for what we doThe MXL Studio 24 mic more than meets our needs (which may be different from yours).Recommended!CFH
