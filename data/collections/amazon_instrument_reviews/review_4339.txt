These FAB pedals are cheap and mostly mediocre, but I bought this on a whim to use with a Fender tube amp and it works well. As other reviewers have stated, the pedal does not have very good build quality but it seems to hold up okay as long as it's not abused. I use the echo with both a telecaster and a cigar box guitar for vintage effects.I have found that the delay works well around 50 percent and the mix can be modulated to make a good mix of reverb and delay. I don't know if I would gig with this pedal or any othe FAB pedal because of my tendency to step hard on a pedal in live environments, but it serves it's purpose well and is cheaper than alot of other delay and echo pedals if you just need a basic effect. I have seen info about modding the pedal to control the delay and may do this in the future.I have alot of other pedals and I tried this pedal with a jazz bass, with some EQ tinkering, I found a good mix of echo. I originally saw a youtube video of a bass player using a D-4 and thought it would be a good idea. Again, Danelectro makes a higher end echo pedal which probably does a better job with delay, but this is a good deal and was $100 dollars cheaper than my Electro Harmonix Memory Boy pedal and sounds cool as a vintage vibe with an old amp.
