I've owned a couple of Pedaltrain pedal boards. First the PT-2 and now the Pro. I use this to house a Line6 M13, M9, a Korg Pitchblack tuner, Clyde Deluxe Wah and a Boss channel switch. There's plenty of pedal board real estate for all of this and the soft case is incredibly strong and durable. You can imagine my board being VERY heavy, and it is, but the soft case does a great job. The included Velcro keeps the incredibly heavy M9 and M13 securely in place even when I store the pedal board upright/on edge between weekly gigs. There's also a lot of places to use zip ties to clean up your rig. Also comes with a great little bracket that will house the Voodoo Lab and possibly some other pedal power supplies. Pedaltrain makes a great pedal board.
