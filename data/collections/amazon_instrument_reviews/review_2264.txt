Not much I can add to the review that isn't well covered already. It's a nice bag that offers some protection for your equipment. There are some design flaws that I could see giving some people trouble over time. But overall it's a great product.I just wanted to add that it will work for the HD500X with enough room for all the cables/power-supplies needed for effects pod & digital wireless rig.
