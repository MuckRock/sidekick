I just got it today and haven't spent too much time with it yet. It sounded OK and I like the features on it. I especially like not having to step down hard on the toe to engage the pedal. As soon as you press down it's on. Lots of adjustments so I'll be tweaking for a while to find my sound, but it seems like it's going to be OK. It's a lot different from my crybaby so there will be a little learning curve. For the money It's a great pedal.
