I ordered this and it arrived surprisingly quickly.  It arrived in a large box and within in the Fender Amp box.  I guess 2 boxes is good as it provides more protection.  Sadly, when I tried to use them amp, it didn't work!  I checked the wall plug, cord, flicked several switches and knobs but still didn't work.  Needless to say, I sent the amp back to Amazon which was quick and painless.  I wanted an exchange.  I expected the amp to be received and check out and only then a exchange amp sent to me.  But I was shocked to find out that as soon as the return UPS label was recorded at the UPS store, they shipped out another amp.  And it arrived in 4 days since I returned the first one!  WOW!!! That's customer service.The amp is great.  Small footprint, sounds great for what I want it for which is bedroom/basement practice amp.  Does it's job very nicely.  I explored the FUSE software and the potential is almost endless.  Honestly, I don't think I will every fully utilize the full capability of the FUSE software.  I just need some basic sound and some simple tweeking here and there.  I may use someone else's uploaded presets and play with the various options later on.  In summary, 5 stars for the amp and 5 stars for the customer service.
