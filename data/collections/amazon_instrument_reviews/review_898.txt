I bought my first set a long time ago and they were perfect! Then I re-ordered and I got what I think was an acoustic type because they were the same 2.0mm gauge but were too small for me to comfortably hold, so I just ended up with two dozen wasted picks. So just make sure you get the right one.12.5.11 Update: Okay, so I just realized that there are "Dunlop Stubby Picks" and then there are "Dunlop BIG Stubby Picks" Sorry...
