TheDanelectro Honeytone Mini Amp - Beatnik Burgundyis an easy way to get great sound from your electric guitar. The color of this unit is a soft burgundy (almost brick red in color). Paired with the Zero Hum AC Adaptor, it's a highly portable amp setup. "Ultra-portable" by using a 9V battery instead of the AC adaptor. I do think they are best purchased together to enjoy all the benefits of this rig though.A headphone jack on the amp means you can enjoy the amp's impressive sound quality without bothering the neighbors or waking your spouse.Included with the amp is an Owner's Manual with simple start-up instructions. You'll need to have your own cord (the one that goes from the guitar to the amp isn't provided as part of the amp package...). The manual has several control settings for the following sound tweaks:-Clean & Spanky-Warm Jazz-Big Amp Overdrive-Killer Blues-Distorted Rhythm-Thick Solo-Woodstock Fuzz-Send the Cats Under the Bed-Twang-Mondo Sustain-Brit Solo Tune-Sparkle Clean-Early 80's Clean Solo-Late 60's Neck Solo-70's Brit-70's SoloI paid under $20 for this amp and couldn't be happier with the product. Don't hesitate to pick one up for yourself.UPDATE: 7/19/12There is a space in the back of the unit for 1 9-volt batteryDuracell 9-V Alkaline Batteries, 4-Countor you can use the included AC adapter to power the amp.UPDATE: 9/19/12 Per reviewer Paul Stewart: "As a point of clarity - the current version of this item does NOT ship with an adapter nor cable.
