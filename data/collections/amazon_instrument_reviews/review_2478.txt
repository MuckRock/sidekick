I've been using Finger Ease for years and always will on my acoustic and electric guitars. It has multiple uses:-Cleans off residual oils and buildup from your hands, extending the life and tone of your strings-Lubricates strings and neck for faster and smoother playability, though this effect does typically wear off after an hour or so-Works decently well as a polishing agent to rub off finger prints, etc. from the top, sides, and back, will not harm most finishes (as far as I know)I usually just apply it before playing but using it after could definitely be beneficial as well.I did read that the compound is conductive and should be kept off of your pickups to avoid interference. I'm not sure if this is true as I've never noticed any problem when the spray gets on my humbuckers. However, I typically try to keep it off of electronic  components in general just out of common sense.For under ten bucks, the can will last you awhile.  Just order a few at a time and find free shipping, you'll find yourself wanting one in each guitar case all the time.
