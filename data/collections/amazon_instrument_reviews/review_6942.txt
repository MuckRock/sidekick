I got these for the build in Pop Screen. However I found it can only be attached in one place. This is ok if you are using a full boom that&#8217;s facing the singer. But if you are working in a tight space and the boom stand is to the side of the singer , this presents difficulties. It fits my MXL mic and any mic up to 52mm without a problem.
