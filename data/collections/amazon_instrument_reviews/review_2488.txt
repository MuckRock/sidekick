Works as advertised.  I was a bit skeptical when the product arrived, but I just set up my acoustic guitar with this product and it does work.  Pretty simple, even if you're "technically challenged."  Easy to use.  Haven't gigged with it yet, but I can imagine that this strap "isn't going anywhere," regarding its functionality.  Not a "pretty" product, but good stuff.
