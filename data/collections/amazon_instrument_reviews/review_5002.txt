I never really had an issue with tuning stability with the stock tuners on my American Standard Strat. What interested me the most was the easy string changes and locking tuners have really helped with that. But I have noticed that it does stay in tune better than before. These are easy to install and simple to use. All you need is a 10mm socket and your are set. As others have pointed out, these are staggered so there are 3 long ones and 3 short ones so you need to make sure you get them on the right way. It only took a couple of minutes to install and they fit like a glove. I've read some people complaining about the additional weight on the headstock but I don't even notice the difference. They work just like genuine Fender parts would be expected.
