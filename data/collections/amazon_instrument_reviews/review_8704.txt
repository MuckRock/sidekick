A great idea, but pure crap in terms of functionality.  if you don't have something heavy on the flat end, the rubber piece moves, and before you know it, your axe is on the ground.  I saw some pictures of putting a 12 ounce can on the flat part as a counterweight, but I'm not so hot with that idea, especially if the can is open.  The lip need to extend down longer, and *something* needs to be done on the bottom of the flat portion to stop this gadget from moving around.  If I had a permanent place to mount this, I'd gorilla glue it down, but that then defeats the beauty of this being mobile and I'll get an extra guitar stand instead.  Good idea, but it doesn't work.
