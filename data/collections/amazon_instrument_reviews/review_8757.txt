I bought this guitar case for wife, as she plays a acoustic guitar and needed to replace her &#34;GIG bag( soft case) with a hard case that would protect her guitar better than the soft case could. She absolutely loves the case and it is well built and when you use it, it makes you think that this case should cost more, but for the $60, it is an awesome deal.The case fits her acoustic like a glove and has a storage compartment for her Mic cable, DI box , picks and tuner. Underneath the neck, there is enough space for storage of two sets of extra guitar strings. You  might pay more for a NAME brand case...save some money for soemthing else an dget this case, because it is a great deal. We found nothing negative that we could say about it. It also was packaged VERY well to protect the case during shipment and came very quick.
