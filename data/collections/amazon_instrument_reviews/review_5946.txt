This is one of many Behringer pedals that offer a unique, stand-alone sound. The chorus effects are well known, and even included on many amps, and featured on almost every multi-effects pedal. I like the individual pedals because I can add in just what I want instead of relying on someone else's idea in a pre-set. This Chorus is just about right. It has a range of sounds for different situations, and is very reliable and well made. There is no problem with the B. tough plastic cases. If you want a metal housing, it's for some sentimental reason, thinking that metal is automatically better or more durable than plastic. You just need to push the off on switch, not bat baseballs.
