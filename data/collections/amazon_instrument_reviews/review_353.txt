I had been learning on a Squier for about six months and really wanted a better guitar. After doing research, reading reviews, and checking it out in a guitar store, I chose this one.It's much easier to play than the Squier, and it has a better sound. Like the Squier (but not as bad), it gets a little buzzy on the top strings. I suspect it might need to be adjusted, but I don't have a clue as to how to go about it.It's also a good choice for women. I'm a small woman, and I really like that the neck is smaller. It's also fairly lightweight.Overall, I'm happy with my choice. A guitar tech told me it's the best guitar out there under $500. Maybe. I expect to be happy with it for a few years before I upgrade again.
