I love these clip on ,vibration reading tuners, This was the second one I tried , The first was a Barcus Berry, which worked equally well, They both have lots of features, such as tap tempo, up and down tuning adjustments. With the Barcus Berry, it was the first one, after trying the Snark, which is a cool name and a lot more colorful, I tuned up a brand new guitar in a store , out of the box in less than 2 minutes, never came close to doing that before. That convinced me, the Quicktunes I had been using were accurate, but these seemed to be better, and get you perfect, I have heard that they work better on acoustic instruments, which makes sense, they put out a lot more vibrations than a solid body electric.From the literature it, seems that the snark could have been made by the quicktune company and the company that makes the cool cats pedals, that have been raved about.Hello, Raving bout this. I seen on Amazon they are cheaper, I bought a blue guitar only one at my local store for 19.99, here they are around 10 to 12 bucks. These type of tuners, especially the intellitouch are popular wih Bluegrass folk like me, The grapics on this are great , no more shaky needle, just a dead on still reading when you are perfect.
