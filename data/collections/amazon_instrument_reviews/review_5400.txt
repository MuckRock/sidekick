I have had to use these because the stage was so wide you could not use anything shorter. Most stages in bars, clubs and restaurants are small enough to use 25' mic cables and reach the stage box of the snake, but not all. These GLS Audio cables have been transparent and sturdy for the 2 months that I have been using them on an almost daily basis. I have performed many setups and tear down with these cables and there is no indication of any problem coming up any time soon.
