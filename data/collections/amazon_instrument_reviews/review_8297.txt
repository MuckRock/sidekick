I purchased this to use with my old Yamaha acoustic guitar and my ukelele.  It works great on both, very accurate and easy to use.  The swiveling head works very nicely and makes it easy to see at any angle.  It appears sturdy, and the clamp appears soft enough not to scratch your instrument. I haven't used other tuners of this type, but this one works great and seems like a great value for the price.
