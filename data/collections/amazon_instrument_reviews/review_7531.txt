I had done a fair amount of research on banjos before I bought this. It has many of the same components of a more expensive banjo and plays very well. Yes there many banjos and some with more frills. There is no indication of where this banjo was made, but the quality is top notch. I am a woodworker and judge workmanship closely. I see no flaws on my banjo. I did not have the problem with the 5th string machine being to tight as others. I bought mine from [...], the same place it ships if you buy it at Amazon best was 10 bucks cheaper with free shipping. If I could give it more than 5 stars I would. I can play a guitar and learning a few banjo chords was easy. I also have very large hands with chubby fingers and was worried about it having a small neck, that is not a issue either. While I am expert on banjo I would gladly buy another and see no reason to spend more money at this point and probably not later on either. A keeper for sure.
