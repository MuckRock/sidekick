This unit is well constructed.Switches and knobs feel sturdy.The user guide is informative.It has a wide tone range. I usually play a Hofner club bass and it sounds deep and clear.It is useful if you want to dial in a good sound and just leave it set. It doesn't have presets. You can loop an effects processor thru it.
