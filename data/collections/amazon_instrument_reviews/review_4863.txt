I have a pretty weird pedalboard set-up involving an EHX digital Memory Man looped back into itself and another split earlier in the pedal chain.  This does a great job of summing three outputs back into one signal before I go into a reverb pedal and then out to my amp.  Takes a little while to dial in exactly where the knobs should be, and they get very loud at the top end, but I have noticed no issues with sound with each knob at around 4.5/10.  I tested to see if I could tell any difference in noise due to this pedal but found none.
