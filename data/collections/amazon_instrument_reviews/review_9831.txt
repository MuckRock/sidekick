It is okay. It serves the purpose. It is a good fit for the soprano uke. A pull tab for one of the zippers broke off within a week. Not a big deal I just stuck a zip tie in its place. The case is not a cheap trash bag style gig bag but a heavy nylon with some padding to it. It has a pocket on the front to hold some small gear. There is no support for the neck inside like in a guitar case. It will keep your uke from getting scratched or dusty, but will not provide much more protection than that.
