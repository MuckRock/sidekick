You may wat to reconsider buying ANY filter.On this model, the top (filter) part is essentially pantyhose wrapped around a cardboard tube.Despite this, the clamp and adjuster parts are relatively good.In all honesty, Buy a nicer filter, or none at all. They do NOT make a huge difference on recording quality unless you're using Top-of-the-line microphones. If this is the case, spend the money to get a nicer filter.One nice thing- these keep artists from getting too close to the mic and essentially making out with them. I found that quality nice when dealing with... passionate vocalists.
