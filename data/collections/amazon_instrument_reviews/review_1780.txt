This is definitely a high quality cable. However, my experience with this model and the less expensiveMonster Standard 100 Instrument Cable 21 ft. - straight 1/4 plugs S100-I-21model has shown me that the only difference is one is "prettier" with its gold colored, bling fittings. Sonically I found them to be the same - or to my ears anyway.As you can see by the tag above this review Amazon has verified that I purchased this cable (as well as Amazon verifying my purchase of the less pricey model on my review on that product page.)I initially purchased a pair of these cables for my keyboards because I had invested a significant sum into those instruments and wanted nothing but the best cables. I purchased the standard cables for some low end instruments including an old Squier Jazz Bass and a new, but very inexpensiveEpiphone LP Special II Les Paul Electric Guitar, Vintage Sunburst, neither of which to my mind warranted top of the line cables.Much to my surprise, when I started testing each cable on each instrument (all through the same amp to keep things equal), I could not discern any sonic difference between both Monster cable models. Same manufacturer, but different models. To be sure, this more expensive model looked "cooler", but when it came to sound - no discernible difference (that I could detect anyway.)  More perplexing is the molded stress relief ends on the less expensive model seem to make that one more reliable!My recommendation is test both this one and the standard model side-by-side before plunking down extra money for no added value beyond looks (which, I have to admit, may be a selling point on stage for some folks - no shame as long as you know what you are paying extra for and why.)
