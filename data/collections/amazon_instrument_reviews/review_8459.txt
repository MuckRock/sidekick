I've owned two of these pedals and they both  had the same quirk. The delay is amazing, the repeats trail and decay beautifully,The controls give you a wide range of tones...But, They've both randomly gone into a feedback loop on me!  One constant high pitched screeching tone!My signal chain was low gain, And its done it when it was the only pedal In the chain, so It's not  another pedals Influence... I love the sound, but, I won't use it live in case of feedback...That being said its still a very good pedal.
