This is a cheaply built cable.  It has basic ends, they screw on but seem to come loose and need tightening frequently.  The only truly redeeming feature of this cable is it's tiny length : 3 feet.  I use it with my Honey Tone Belt portable ampDanelectro N10A Honey Tone Mini Amp in Aqua, so the cable has to be short.  The amp is on my belt. I use it, thus, just like Jackson and Cole, reviewers below.  Like Jackson, I have a RISA solid body electric ukulele.Let me say, three feet is short, very short.  If you want to put the amp down on the floor, you'd better be (a) short, and (b) siting right over it, because when you find out how limiting three feet cable really is, you'll recognize that you can only use this for one thing: a portable amp, close to or on your body.I suppose you could use it to connect a couple of guitar pedals and not have too much cable, but them again, most connector cables are even shorter.Glad I have it only for the purpose I intended.  Wish it was heftier, stronger, better looking, like my other guitar cables.
