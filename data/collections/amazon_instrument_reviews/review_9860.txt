Unbelievable clear sounding on a Mandolin.  Can't yet get the sound out of a violin that I want with it but still experimenting.  Will have to find a way to keep the cord secure while it's connected as the slightest movement or adjustment makes a lot of noise.All in all 7$ very well spent.  Thank goodness pickup prices are coming down.  Only a few years ago you could not find a pickup-mic even this good for &#60;100$.  Now if only the price of pickup-chics would come down. :(
