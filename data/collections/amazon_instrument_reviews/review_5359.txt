I bought this and a Hohner Special 20 key of C harp to test them both out. This harp is a great harp, pretty much the exact same as the Hohner Special 20 in overall quality. "Feels" a little more airtight, brighter and louder than the hohner, but in side-by-side testing the effect is diminished.The Hohner Special 20 just seems to have this little extra...expression to it. More life or something.Both harps very bendable, etc. Real high quality.As for the replaceable reed plates...Amazon has this harp marked down to about the $25 level. Reed plate replacements are about $19. Now I realize that at retail that's half the price of a RETAIL harp, but only $6 less than a "whole new harp" otherwise.With this in mind, I would generally recommend beginners start with the Hohner Special 20. Just a slightly better or at least more fun-sounding and fun to play harp with a little more animation and expression available "free", in my opinion.
