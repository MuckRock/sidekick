I returned the SKB PS-45 and got the PT-2 as a replacement.  The SKB is a well built board, but the Pedaltrain boards are simply the best functional design available, period!!  And designing them with the Voodoo Lab Pedal Power in mind is stroke of genius.  Providing the brackets to mount......another brilliant stroke.  This is a no-brainer.  This is your best option for a top flight pedalboard.  Great job!
