fist off, guitar center had this for 29 bucks!!! I KNOW RIGHT. It was in front of the tag for this (30 bucks) and the sp-1 for 14.99 so I got it, but it was in the wrong spot, I went, got the price tag, and after minimal drama, they gave it to me for the price they had it INCORRECTLY listed.that said, the pedal is great. The problem people have with the pedal, as I can see it, if they say it or not, is that some sounds DON'T HAVE THE SAME SUSTAIN AS A PIANO OR SYNTH SOUND. It has been fun playing organ sounds and trying to "pump the pedal" to keep sustain and not "wash out" the tone. this thing is great and if anyone needs a pedal for their synth (I have a casio wtk-4200 I believe), it is as good as you need. As said, any over-sustaining is when you need to learn when and where to release and start the sustain again, which is the true art of it. 30 bucks? robbers.
