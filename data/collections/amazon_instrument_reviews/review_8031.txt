This is a pop filter. It does a fantastic job at that. The plastic rings feel a little cheap, but that is just because they need to be lightweight. Ultimately, this is a great pop filter and the goose-neck is very strong but flexible. I would highly recommend this piece, as it also enforces a strong habit of stepping away from the microphone just a bit and not getting too close.
