I'm in a situation where I have to sit to play due to hip problems, and it has been tough finding the right on stage seat.  For me, a stool is too high, and a folding chair too low, plus I need something that folds in with my other equipment.On it's tallest setting, this gives me the exact height I need. I'm 6', so it might not be high enough for a very tall person.It is also sturdy, I'm very animated when I play, and the support feels solid after several gigs of 2 to 3 hours. The cushioning is nice and thick as well.
