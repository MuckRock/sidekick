This strap is value for money. I was surprised when I got it - I didn't expect something so good at this price! The material is shiny, blue and doesn't look cheap and the strap is generously wide. The ends are leather with one side having a golden EB logo. Goes well with my black Squier Strat. Highly recommended!
