I don't have a lot of experience with effects stomp boxes, but enough to know when I have a winner. Behringer's TM300 is made from tough plastic. The 3 other Beheringers I have had about a year don't look warn and scarred, and sound as good as the day I got them. The tube mode pedal has an incredible flavor of tones. Fender clean, bright, British crunch and distortion, a hot  Gain and sweet smooth California sound.  I am playing out of a Peavey, but I hear a tweed. Amazing clarity, and worth the $28 and change. You won't be disappointed.
