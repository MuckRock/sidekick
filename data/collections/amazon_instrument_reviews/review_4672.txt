I've relied on this stuff for years, and it has yet to let me down.  I play my guitars quite frequently, and they tend to collect a fair amount of sweat, etc., during a show. A couple sprays of this product and a quick wipe down with a guitar chamois return my axe to its shiny self, with zero degradation to the finish. I've even used this on matte or light finishes with good results.Tip: a little goes a long way. I play every week, I use this stuff every time I put away a guitar, and it still takes me at least a year or so to finish a bottle.  I figure this stuff costs me about 25 cents per month.  :)
