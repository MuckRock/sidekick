This is a good stand.  I've had other stands of tubular construction in the same price range before, and this one is definitely much sturdier.  It fits every guitar I've put in it just fine, and holds them rather steady even without fastening the clumsy band across the neck.  If you have ever been tempted to lean your guitar against something, then you owe it to your instrument to pick one of these up.
