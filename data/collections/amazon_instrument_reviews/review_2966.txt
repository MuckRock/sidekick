I put these in my Ibanez EW acoustic-electric as a cosmetic upgrade and the tone and sustain is absolutely amazing, not to mention they look fantastic. They fit like they were made for this bridge but rubbed a bit of pine tar in the holes with a q-tip to make sure they seated fully. Absolutely tickled with the look and performance. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMEND
