I've used this pedal with a Casio PX200 keyboard for about 6 weeks now.Pros:-Sturdy construction (compared with the plastic footswitch type pedals that come with keyboards).-Polarity switch - I was using a Yamaha FC4 with an older keyboard, but the FC4 does not work properly with the Casio keyboards.  It's a tip-negative polarity, and the Privia requires a tip-positive polarity.  So the piano would operate in reverse (sustain on until the pedal is depressed).  Thankfully, the SP-2 has a switch on the bottom that can switch and accomodate any keyboard.-Cord is long enough (6')Con:-Build quality is slightly less than the FC4.  The FC4 has a smooth action (made in Japan), but the SP-2 had some problems with the metal spring squeaking.  Some lubricant helped to fix most of the squeaking.The SP-2 also comes with a plastic cap if you prefer to cover the metal pedal.  Overall, it is a solid product and almost a necessary upgrade for the plastic footswitch pedals.
