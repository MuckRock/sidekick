Just skimming through the other reviews, I see that at least one other reviewer has complained about the same thing. Nearly every time you pick up your guitar, the rest will fall off your desk. The part that sits on the desk should've been weighted to prevent this from happening. It's a nice idea and does what it says - it keeps your guitar nice and safe from scuffs when leaned up against your desk.But considering this one REALLY annoying flaw, I wonder if I shouldn't have just payed a couple more bucks for another guitar stand instead of this rest.
