For a long time, I never thought much about guitar strings. I pretty much thought they were all the same.In fact, guitar strings seem to be enjoying a technological renaissance these days. D'Addario has gotten into the act with these NYXL strings, and I have to say that they are not like any other strings I've used.The feel is different, and the sound is different. Different in a WOW way. Yeah, they're more expensive, but they're worth it. I'm a cheapskate, and I can't go back to cheap strings.Now I'm spoiled, and I've become a guitar strings snob.
