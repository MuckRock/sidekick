I've found these strap locks to be much better than the alternatives by Schaller and Dunlop. These look the best out of all strap locks and have a great feel to them when locking and unlocking your strap.I use them on a PRS SE 245 and I did not need to do any additional drilling. The screws that came with the product went in perfectly and were secure.Highly Recommended.
