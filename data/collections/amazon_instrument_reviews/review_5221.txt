In my 13 years of playing the guitar I have settled on D&#8217;Addario as my string of choice.  When I picked up the mandolin four months ago deciding which string to buy was easy. I&#8217;m really glad I did.  The tone is great, they&#8217;re durable and smooth on the fingers.  Even though they are smaller strings they still produce the sustain and bell-like tone that mandolinists are after.  They respond great to different styles and dynamic levels.  You can play sweet classical passages, roaring bluegrass and even rock.  I have a high end Washburn F-Style and these strings coupled with Wegan picks make the Washburn sound SPECTACULAR!  They also bring out the sound of the wood too which I appreciate.  If you are in need of a smaller string that still sounds good, this is the pack to get. Thanks D&#8217;Addario for providing an awesome product!
