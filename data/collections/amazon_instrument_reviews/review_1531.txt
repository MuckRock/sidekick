I put a set of Elixir Nanoweb custom light strings on my main acoustic guitar maybe a couple of months ago.  Although I don't play gigs on it, I play the guitar just about every day, or maybe every other day.  The custom lights are wonderful:  great durability, nice tone and projection, easy on the fingers.  I bought a set of the Elixir extra lights for a Laguna 3/4 size travel guitar I have.  The reasoning was that the lighter body guitar with a shorter scale could use lighter strings, thereby putting less stress on the body.  Compared with the light D'Addario strings that came with the guitar, these have a more muffled low E string.  The A string, too, doesn't project as much as the standard strings.  Although I've not tried the extra lights on my full-sized acoustic, I suspect that there, too, the lower strings would not have the presence or ring of other brands.  Even with the custom light set--where the lower strings are a heavier gauge than a normal light set--the bass notes have a slight hint of that muffled quality.  The thing that most players of Elixirs seem to talk about is the playability and the durability.  They are smoother feeling than non-coated strings, and certainly don't degrade because of perspiration nearly as quickly as regular strings.  The other thing that's important to know, though, is that the Elixirs are excellent at holding a tune, once they're stretched and broken in.  That being said, I'm not sure that I would put the extra lights on the Laguna again because of the bass projection issue:  a small guitar has little enough bass to begin with and these strings don't help.  As you might have guessed, though, I'm thoroughly convinced about the custom lights on the full-sized acoustic.
