The concept of this guitar stand is great, and I thought it would be perfect for my two Telecasters...That is until I get the stands in place and put the guitars in them. The stands have a very deep angle, and from what I could tell, the guitars were sitting about 40 to 45 degrees back.It just looks silly, like your guitars are trying to slip out of the stand, or are in a slow-motion fall backwards. It also ends up taking up WAY too much space, as the stand has to be set out from the wall or corner quite a bit for clearance purposes. I ended up returning these stands, but would definitely buy again if they produced a more upright version.
