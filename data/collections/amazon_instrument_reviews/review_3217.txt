I have several other amps ranging from half stacks to twins and this little guy fills a definite hole. I mainly play an American Standard Tele and the 25R fits her like a glove. I love the tone and the reverb for $100 is amazing! The dirty channe is what it is, but the clean channel is worth the price of admission.I can imagine using this guy for a small gig, but I mainly use it for practice and jamming over night while everyone else is sleeping. If you are in the market for a sweet little amp with a very rich clean channel and classic spring reverb you should look no further, this really is a great little amp!**Update**If you are interested in a DIY amp stand that will enhance the sound of the amp, check out my review and amp stand plans for the 25R on my website![...]
