It would be improper for me to claim that these FIT Stratocasters, because I have a Stratocaster remake and I drilled new holes for a Stratocaster pickguard to get the screws in. What I can say is that the packaging is nice and doesn't seem cheapo (surprised it didn't come all scattered in an envelope or in a ziplock bag) the size of the screws was right, the dark chrome finish on the screws is pretty slick, and it came with more than enough to install a Stratocaster pickguard. I'm sure the screws are the right length to fit authentic Stratocasters anyways.
