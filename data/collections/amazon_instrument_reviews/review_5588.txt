I've owned a TS808 since I purchased it used in the 80s for around $20.  Yes, this is a great overdrive.  This pedal has many famous users and it has been used on many iconic recordings.  Pair this with a strat and run it into an amp on the verge of breakup - now you're in tone heaven.  But the plain truth is this:  there are tons of pedals out there now that do what this does - and they do it for a fraction of the cost of the 808 reissue.  This was the original but by no means the last word in overdrives.  I own a boatload of other dirt boxes and while this one is iconic it's not the most transparent or versatile. There is a 'mid hump' in the EQ of this pedal that either sits well with what you are playing or it doesn't.  I'm glad I own mine but I don't think I'd shell out what they are charging these days for the reissue.  If I am not mistaken both the TS9 and the TS7 can be modded to this circuit with less than 25 cents in parts and about 15 minutes of your time.  If this pedal came in under the $100 mark it would be more deserving of five stars.  I really hate to burst anyone's bubble but SRV's tone was really in his fingers.  And so is yours ;)
