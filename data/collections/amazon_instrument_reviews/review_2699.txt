I bought this strap to use with an acoustic bass that is rather gargantuan,- A Tacoma 4 string, after a bit of adjustment it worked great. Then I bought an ovation 12 string roundback (very roundback this is a deep dish) I needed a strap to make this bad boy sit where I was, so I grabbed this strap off the bass and gave it a shot. After adjusting it for the difference in size it worked great. Now I'm buying another strap so I will have one on either guitar.(I usually keep a strap on all my guitars if the cases will allow it, sure beats taking them off and putting them on)This strap is very comfortable on an acoustic/electric guitar, probably more so than on a bass as it is supporting less weight. Due to the width of the strap it distributes the weight over a larger area, meaning less pressure on any specific area. This makes it very comfortable.I might change all my guitar straps from 2" to 3" now that I've had a taste of comfort.If you aren't comfortable playing, than you are distracted which removes you from the creative moment. This helps keep you in the moment and in the groove and it don't cost a fortune, plus it holds a pick or two.I like my phat strap just fine.
