The cobalt seems like it gives the strings a silkier feeling. Maybe it's just me, but that's how they come across. I noticed that these strings become discolored quicker than the stock steel, but don't lose that new sound new as fast. I didn't have near as much string stretch with these either. I'll keep using them, just maybe in a different gauge.
