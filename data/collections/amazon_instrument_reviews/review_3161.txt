I picked this up because I wanted to change up the looks of my 3-tone sunburst American Standard. The holes lined up perfectly and it was easy to install but that's what you'd expect since this is a genuine Fender part. The only concern really is whether or not the color will work on your guitar. At first, it took some getting used to as it really darkened up the look of my Strat but I like the way it came out with aged white pick up covers and knobs.
