This is one great piece of equipment. Even on an unplugged electric guitar, just clamp it on the end of the guitar, and it picks up vibration for tuning easily, and tunes spot-on. Adding to that is it's convenient small size, and being unbelievably cheap price. Why spring for an expensive tuner when this does such a good job?
