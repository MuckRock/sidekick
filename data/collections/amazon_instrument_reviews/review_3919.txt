This is a tough deal to beat on a boom stand. It is very well made, and it is very adjustable so no issues sitting or standing, playing with an instument or just singing. Only thing, make sure you read the description well. It is a euro stand so it has 5/8"-27 threads. It does not come with a mic clip. When I ordered my mic from Behringer, their clip had 3/8" standard threads which obviously would not attach. I ordered a univeral clip so that drove the cost up some. Now if the manufacture would just provide a clip, they would have the best stand deal going. Overall, I would buy again!
