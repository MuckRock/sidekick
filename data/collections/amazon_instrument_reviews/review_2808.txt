I've used D'Addario's on so many different Guitar's the only opinion I can honestly give Ya is that They are the best. In the Studio or on Stage, They stay in tune and work very well with any pickup You are using. I put these on My Wife's Bass cause She is still learning and with a Fender Squire it sounds almost as good as a Precision Fender Bass. They stay true to the note so She will get to know what the pitch and note should sound like every time......
