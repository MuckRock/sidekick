This capo works very well!It applies just enough pressure due to the adjustable design.  The rubber seems to hold well - it's a bit thin and seems like it could wear over an extended period of time, but I've had no issues as of yet.My guitar stays tuned for longer periods due to this capo's design.  I also have a quick-change Keyser and I can say I prefer this one for practice sessions, but the Keyser for performing.  This one is too slow for the stage.
