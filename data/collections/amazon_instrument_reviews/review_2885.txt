Excellent steel guitar strings, each string has a color coded end, each 6-string bag has three bundles of two strings which makes it even easier to figure out which string goes where.  Purchased a 3 set box, and each box was in a seperate sealed bag for freshness.  I went with the mediums.  Try the light if you are a beginner.
