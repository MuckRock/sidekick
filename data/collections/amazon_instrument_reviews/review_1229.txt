Changed the strings on my Epiphone EB-0 bass today for the first time using this product.Fit the extra large tuning pegs on my bass with room to spare.  Cutter works great, winder makes the job really fast.  10 minutes it took for all 4 strings.  Next time will be much faster now that i know what im doing.  Highly recommended
