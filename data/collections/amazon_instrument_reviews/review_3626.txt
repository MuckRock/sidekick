I bought a couple of sets of strings for my banjo. Strings are a matter of preference of how they sound and feel. One person may love them the next may not. They are very playable strings, but on my aluminum rim saga banjo the sound was a little to bright. I took them off and put them on a another wood resonater banjo, they sounded much better on that one. One reason I buy these strings is they are made in the U.S.A Why buy strings when they don't tell you where there made.I put on a set of Daddrio medium set and liked the sound better but they are a little harder to play.All strings must be kept clean if you want them to last. wipe each string when done and they will last longer.
