Yes this product is simple and expensive enough to raise some eyebrows. But this tool is very well designed. It keeps the guitar from sliding and positions it at a nice angle for maintenance. In storage mode, the mat rolls up into the clear plastic tube and takes up very little space. The bottom cover doubles as a storage compartment for your hex wrenches, string winder, and feeler guages.But the real reason I give this product five stars is because it allows me to work on my guitars while keeping them in perfect condition. That increases their resale value, so the tool pays for itself. And it gives me a lot of pleasure to have the right tools for the job. With the right tools, I enjoy working on my guitars almost as much as playing them. While I hear what those complaining of the high cost are saying, I am used to paying higher prices for good tools and I think this qualifies as a good tool. I used it to put new pickups in and setup my Squier Stratocaster last night without damaging my guitar. Without this tool, I don't think I would have been so lucky.
