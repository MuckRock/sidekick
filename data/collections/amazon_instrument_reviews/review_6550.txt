This device has been a blessing for my bass guitar practices. Armed with a set of headphones, I can play anywhere in the house at any time while also jamming to my MP3s (mp3 player plugged in too!).Worth the small price you pay.As far as construction, the battery door BARELY hangs on. I'm sure if I drop it, even from a low height, that door's flying off along with the battery.
