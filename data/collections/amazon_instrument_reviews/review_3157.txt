Used this to replace a dead volume pot in an older Strat-type guitar, and it sounds great!  The diameter of the threaded portion was a little larger than the original, Chinese pot, so I needed a cheap reamer (purchased through Amazon) to enlarge the pickguard hole.  It's a nice, smooth pot with no scratchiness.  nice big lugs to solder to.
