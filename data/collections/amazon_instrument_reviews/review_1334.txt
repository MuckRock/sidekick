Overall, I like this winder.  It's handy having the wire cutter built into it.  But when I am winding new strings, it often slips off.  Since I am using one hand to hold tension on the new string, I would prefer this to hold on more securely so I don't have to put it back on several times.  But all in all, it's a lot better than winding by hand, and it seems sturdy.
