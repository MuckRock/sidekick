I bought this because after I rebuilt a guitar that was very special to me it wouldn't stay in tune. I took it to a number of guys thinking I did something wrong in the build and was just overlooking it. I use a capo a lot so when someone recommended this...I thought they were crazy. I'm not paying that much for a capo and I doubt that is the problem. Well....I broke down and I'm glad I did. This thing is amazing. It solved the problem because I can set the tension and the design make it sit just right on my strat. Spend the money...it's worth it. Only con is that it takes some practice to change it quickly.
