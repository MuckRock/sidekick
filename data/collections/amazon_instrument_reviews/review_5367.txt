My son and daughter love playing with this mic and stand. It comes with a cord that has a standard 1/4 inch end. I plugged it into a small guitar amp. They use it mainly to sing along with their cds/mp3's. Note that this is not really a mic I would use in my studio - it is more of a toy to be honest, but a quality toy for a young child. In that regard I give it five stars.
