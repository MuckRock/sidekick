The Mooer Pitch Box in the harmonist mode blends the dry signal with the altered pitch, and in the pitch shift mode if filters out the dry signal.The pitch knob allows you to raise the note 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 24 semitones, or lower the note by 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, and 24 semitones.I found that putting a distortion pedal in front of the Pitch Box made the harmonies more pronounced. Making how well it tracks and handles bends and vibrato more noticeable. And in general it helps it sounds more like a guitar and less like an organ.When I had the pitch box in front of the distortion pedal, it had this constant warble that sounded like an out of tune guitar. The detune mode sounds like a chorus but I almost never use it.
