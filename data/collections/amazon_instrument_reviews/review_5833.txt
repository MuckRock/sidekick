My guitars largely stay at home, so they don't require the heavy duty protection of a large hard case.  Hard cases almost always cost 70 dollars or more, and also take up about twice as much room, which is problematic for storing multiple instruments.  In most cases, a good soft gig bag with padding should protect your instrument against light bumps and bangs, and costs about 1/4 of the price of a hard case.I bought two different variations of the Fender Gig Bag, and I believe the one pictured here is the one that has Fender Medium guitar picks as zipper handles, which is a cool touch.  The case fits my Fender/Squier Strat guitars (or other guitars of a similar size) snugly.  There is not a ton of padding, but more than you might think from the pictures, especially on top.  The pocket is fine, and there are a variety of adjustable handles and straps.  I can't say that the zippers will withstand years of use, but for most uses, they should do just fine.  Glad to have this as an affordable option to protect my guitars.
