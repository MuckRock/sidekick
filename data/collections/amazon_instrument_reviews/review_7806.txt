Theses strings really have a good tone and tremolo stability greatly improves!!! The heavy bottons 32, 42 and 52 adds a BOOM in the tone. The others, 10, 13 and 17 are nicely and decent tone also. I don't rate it 5 stars for the lack of VCI. When i opened the pack there were no plastic anti corrosion protection. The high strings were plenty of flakes. If fender solved that it would be perfect.
