I've used quite a few strings out there and imo these are the best for feel, sound and overall quality. If you play Fender instruments you can't go wrong using their strings. Of course strings are a subjective thing so to each his own but I will say I used 2 different strings most of my life but was in a guitar store one day and picked up a Tele and was immediately impressed with the strings. I looked at the back and noticed they were colored ends so I thought they were D'Addario strings which I found to be odd considering it was a new Fender. So I did a little research and found that Fender was indeed doing the colored ends now as well. Been buying them ever since and love them.
