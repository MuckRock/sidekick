Impressed with this set, I installed them today and have been playing for a few hours. My wife thinks my guitar looks better now, and I agree. Im not sure if they are supposed to be flush, and they stick out just a little bit but they have not popped out. I think my guitars tone has improved a little too, but I also installed new strings. Qualtiy is way better then the plastic pins!
