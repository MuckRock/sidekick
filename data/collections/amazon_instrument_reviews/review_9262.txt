A bought this pedal to see how such a cheap stomp box could get such great reviews.  Plugging it in and playing it for 5 minutes one can see.  It has tons of gain on tap, it responds well to the guitars volume knob, it creates a wall of overdriven amp tonal love.The pedal cuts through and is articulate.  It's not for modern metal but it can do any kind of hard rock.  Think AC/DC and Van Halen to Metallica.  It's a classic rock pedal that screams!!!Buy it.
