I acknowledge that this is a minority opinion - perhaps I just had bad luck with my unit and the attempts to repair it afterwards.  But while I loved the sound and functionality of this wah-wah pedal, it would literally last me a few months at a time before it became unusable.  I suspected that the potentiameter was shot, so I had that replaced, but the same problems reoccurred.  Like a horrible static noise as soon as started using it.Good product, but hopefully they make them more durable than the particular unit I had.
