Had the old stamped one and was upgrading all the chrome some I put one of these on.  They work perfect and look good.  You get 2 in package (with screws) so I have a spare.Update I only had one on E/B but went ahead and added one for G/D.  Works and look great!!!  google "stratocaster string tree placement" if you are unsure of where and how to install.
