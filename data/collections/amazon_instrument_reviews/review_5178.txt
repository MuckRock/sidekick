I love these microphones, I really do. I also believe that it was really cool they threw in the microphone holders and the case is quite nice. The 2 things I did not like was 1, the microphone has to be really close to your mouth to get a good sound out of it, otherwise it does not sound as crisp. 2, although it was nice of them to include the microphone holders, the items they work with are very limited so make sure that they match up with a microphone stand you want to buy or else it won't screw in. It is good to be aware the wire that connects to this microphone is an XLR Female, so buy the correct wire when connecting to an amp/speaker. For the price I really do recommend these, as long as your fine with having to put the microphone centered,and close to your mouth. Overall a great product.
