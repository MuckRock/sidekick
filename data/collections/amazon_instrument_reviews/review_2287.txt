Some people are not comfortable using the drywall anchors that are included with this hanger. If the drywall anchors are installed correctly you will have no worries about it pulling out of the drywall. I have used these drywall anchors for 10 years now to hang heavy wood blinds which are raised and lowered daily without anchor failure. Concrete block homes exterior walls have no studs to anchor this hanger. The only options are the drywall anchors. They are good to go.
