I have owned this product for a while now & it has some awesome features. This little Recorder is absolutely amazing for it's size. Takes some practice to appreciate all the features. I recommended this Recorder to a fellow musician friend & he bought one also from Amazon & he loves it & records all his gigs with it now instead of the old huge unit he was using & told me it does a much better job than his old unit. He even used his on a tripod to record a gravesite funeral service that his family can keep for memories of a loved one.
