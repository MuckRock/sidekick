Nicely made and a good value but it seems to be a bit stiff right now.It is a single strip of leather with no padding.Maybe it just needs to be broken in.Compliments the color on my Lake Placid blue strat well.For the record, this strap is actually quite long - even in the second strap hole.I am about 5'9" and a trim 155 lbs.At the shortest setting I can manage, the strap is too long to keep the heastock up effectively when I am sitting.Update 2011-Jul-31: The strap is still rather stiff.I will probably pick up a white cotton strap.Those fit well and can be resized a lot more efficiently, in my opinion.
