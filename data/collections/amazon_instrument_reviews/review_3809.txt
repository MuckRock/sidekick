It's a bent piece of metal with conveniently spaced slots and some sort of black coating...powder coat? paint? who knows? it's black.It's heavy enough that it doesn't flex unnecessarily. It has some heft to it, so if you're trying to keep your rack super light be aware of that. The coating is strong. The pre-stamped slots go sideways so that if your gear does come loose, it slips sideways and not forwards, protecting the knobs.I recently had to drill additional holes in one for a homemade piece of gear with totally random mounting hole locations, and it took a while to get through.I like it enough that I bought another one.
