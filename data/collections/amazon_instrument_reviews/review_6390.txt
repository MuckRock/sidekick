I use this microphone mainly to record music. Occasionally I use it for voice chat where it supposedly excels in quality compared to desktop USB microphones. I think the best way to describe this microphone is that it is &#34;above average&#34; but does not outperform any higher-end non-USB microphones that I have played with in the past. While it is not an &#34;outstanding&#34; microphone, it's still a great entry-level product for those on a budget.The microphone is relatively easy to use (just plug in the USB cable) but it needs some accessories to be efficient. For instance, the stand that comes with the microphone cannot hold the microphone upright. It seems like it will tip over if you breathe on it the wrong way. Remember to buy a solid desk (or floor) stand for the microphone, as well as a shock mount and a pop filter.
