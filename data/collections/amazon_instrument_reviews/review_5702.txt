I'm using this in V1 in a 5 watt tube amp.  It's really nice.  I tried the NOS route and I much prefer this tube.  The other good thing is it comes in a box from JJ, unlike some tubes from other places I've ordered where they seem to lose their original boxes along the way and it looks like everyone and their brother has been messing with them.
