If you are familiar with the Pedaltrain products, you know how solid this product is. If you are new to effects, it comes with plenty of velcro to mount pedals and brackets to mount a power brick (they have a deal with Voodoo so those bricks are will always fit). Keep in mind you will have to drill holes for the brackets, they are not predrilled.The duffel bag that it comes with has lots of padding and pockets and is pretty durable. If you have a power strip, it won't fit around the edges of the bag; the fit inside the bag is snug. That said, I have a couple extra pedals not on my board that will fit in the pouch on the side along with strings and cables.
