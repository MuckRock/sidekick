Running 3 to 5 pedals on my board, this was a logical choice of power. The single transformer running into the board with the multi-plug was easy to set up and the small profile of the plugs, combined with the thin cables makes for a neat and uncluttered board. There is no lin drop of power and the devices are able to draw the current needed to work at their peak. Further, with the transformer being well away from the board, there is zero AC hum. What's not to like here?
