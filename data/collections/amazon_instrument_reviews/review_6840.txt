These are great picks, and YES, they are slippery.The reason is the material, and method of manufacturing:Delflex polymer picks are injection molded with a blend of acetyl, making them extremely durable and bright sounding. Unlike stamped picks, which are manufactured from sheet film and can have a different feel when rotated, injection molded picks have the same flexibility in all directions.These are probably the brightest sounding picks I have ever used, and it is well worth gettingused to hanging on to them.I use the 61MM for 10's on my solid body electrics, 76mm for my 11's on semi and hollow bodies,and 1.04mm on my Bass guitar; that's right, I use a plectrum on my Bass.You can get a pick that is easier to hang on to, but you may give away some of that bright snap to a softer to hang on to material like Nylon.
