What can I say that you haven't already read about this amazing pedal? If you thinking about buying the other green overdrive pedal you can save big green with this pedal. If your looking to play out with it know that it's cheaply made and can be destroyed in seconds. Have a backup. Take great  care when plugging and unplugging from this pedal. That alone can cause problems... As far as tone goes it rates very high on the Tone God List. You can go from clean to outright mean with this pedal. It has out muscled my 2 other more expensive name brand overdrive pedals and yes it has earned a permanent spot on my pedalboard. I use it mostly as a clean boost so the pedal is always on and I never turn it off once we start playing. I leave it plugged in on the board all the time. I reach down and use my hand to turn it on and off. I carry a backup pedal... I LOVE THIS PEDAL!...just don't ever drop it...
