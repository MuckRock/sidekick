I write and record my own music.  I stink at writing drums.  I don't play drums, I don't really have room for a drumset, and I really don't want to spend the money on a drumset to see if I can figure it out.  This is a great program for non-drumming, one man bands like me.  MIDI drums and the drum sounds from my Yamaha keyboard just wasn't cutting it.  It works with Ableton Live 9 with no problems.  Tons of different grooves.  It sounds like a real drummer on a real drumset.  Very easy to use.
