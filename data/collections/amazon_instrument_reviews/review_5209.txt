Let me start off by saying I have had several types of humidifiers all of which have worked well. The major upside to this humidifier is you do not have to worry about over-humidifing your guitar! Packets maintain a constant relative humidity and they couldnt be easier to use.One star short of a 5 star review. Why? The price for the replacement packets.Other than that, a wonderful system!
