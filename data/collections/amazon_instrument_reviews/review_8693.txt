I bought this for my husband so he can use it around the home ( he has guitars everywhere). I am not sure he would trust it at a gig and he still uses his guitar stand for that purpose - only because it makes sense to use the most robust guitar stand you can when supporting guitars worth hundreds of dollars.  It is pretty good at staying in place though
