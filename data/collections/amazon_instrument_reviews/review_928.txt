I tried three of these on a whim and they impressed me favorably. In fact, they were so good that I purchased ten more when I went back to the same music store. My favorites are mandolin picks like Golden Gate or Grisman "Dawgs". The round side of the XH Dunlop Gels gives me a similar attack and a nice warm tone. I would recommend these to anyone.
