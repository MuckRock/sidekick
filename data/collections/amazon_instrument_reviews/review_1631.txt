This capo is lightweight and really tough, it is stiff and takes some strength to open but it stays in place and doesn't damage the necks of my guitars. I've used this on acoustic, electric, 7 string, 12 string, and a lot of 6 string guitars and it always works perfectly. I think it's a really nice tool and it does the job flawlessly.
