I first discovered Elixir strings when I purchased my Taylor and I've been a convert ever since.  They cost roughly two or three times as much as uncoated strings but are well worth it.  If your hands perspire when you play, this product will keep your strings sounding new and fresh.  They sound great on my Martin too !
