For the price you cannot go wrong with this.  Holds my Les Paul and feels secure.  I've never had any issues with this.  Don't bother spending 3-4x as much for something that does the job as well as this.EDIT - Bought another one this Christmas for another guitar and this one feels as good and as simple as the first one.
