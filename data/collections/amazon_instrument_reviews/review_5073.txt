Does what it says it will do and it does it very well. The connector is a 3/8in female slot so make sure whatever it is you're buying can connect to that. The mic/boom stand I bought and the on desk stand were both 5/8in male so I had to buy 2 cheap adapters (6$ each). I also am having some issues really "locking" in the Audio-Technica condenser mic to the shock mount. So far it stays in, but isn't "super" secure (wobbles just a little if it's moved), but maybe I'm just doing it wrong. Aside from that, though, great product.
