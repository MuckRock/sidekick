I actually own an even dozen of these.  I've never had any issues with them marring the finish on my acoustic guitars.  They work great & you can't beat the price.  I think I paid around $4.95 for most of the ones I purchased.  Although these are great & I will continue to use them as needed (e.g., when playing), I just replaced these today with Swing String Wall Hangers.  I freed-up so much of my floor space by moving 12 guitars to the wall that I was actually excited about all the free space!!!
