I'll start this by saying I prefer metal slides to glass (tone snob that I am)So I wasn't too excited about playing with this, until I played with it!The tone is amazing!!Great highs, amazing lows, smooth midrange and unbelievable harmonics!I now only use metal slides... And my dunlop bottleneck ;-)
