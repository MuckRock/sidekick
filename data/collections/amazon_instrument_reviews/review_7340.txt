These pick have a permanent, fine coat of rough finish over the translucent material. It wears off and smoothens out around the tip on usage but that does not affect the tone. In fact, I found it increases speed. These are perfect for a fast-paced style of picking. The tone is bright and snappy!Good quality material ensures I won't be needing another set for a long time!
