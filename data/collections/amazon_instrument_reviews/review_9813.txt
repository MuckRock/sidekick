The adjustable tension is a great idea and the open/close lever is designed in such a way that it sits behind the guitar neck and won't get in the way of your hands (unlike the capo I had before this one).  It even comes with a handy pick holder!I could make this review longer, but what else do you really need to know?  If you have a non-classical 6 string guitar, acoustic or electric, this guy should do the trick, regardless of neck shape.  Its a very well designed capo!
