I already owned a stainless version of this capo with a roller instead of the plastic tip on the adjuster screw. I like that one more and overall quality seems better on it, even though pricing was similar when I bought the first one. And the rivets on this one allow the parts to move sideways so they don't line up just right. But when I put it on a guitar it seems to line up okay, and that's the important part.
