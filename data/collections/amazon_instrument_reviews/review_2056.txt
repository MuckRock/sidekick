Wanted to buy a better stand than the cheap metal folding one that I'd had in high school.  This was a great compromise between portability/storage and sturdiness.  I did want collapsible legs, which this has, and the solid coated metal shelf is wonderful after my old metal folding stand.  Works well with the Manhasset second shelf accessory, and has been in constant use for months now.  I've had absolutely no problems with it.  The height is easily adjustable, and the shelf tilt is easy too.  Am very happy with what I got for the price I paid!
