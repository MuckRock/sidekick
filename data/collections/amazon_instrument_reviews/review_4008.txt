Nothing fancy about this strap, unless you want to count the pick pocket at one end. Just well made and functional.I got this for my grandson's Squier (by Fender) 3/4 size acoustic. It doesn't have a strap button at the top end. It would have been nice if this had come with a lace of some type to tie on just above the nut. But I work with leather and I found a nice piece of rawhide lace to serve this purpose. Not everyone would necessarily have the materials at hand.
