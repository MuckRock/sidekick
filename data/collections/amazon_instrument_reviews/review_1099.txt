I bought this recently and I love it. Why?  It has no &#34;smell&#34;, it leaves no residue on your hands, it's very &#34;light&#34; but yet it cleans, shines, and polishes your guitar beautifully.  It leaves a protective coating on the guitar which not only protects the finish, it also makes it ultra-shiny glossy and brings out the rich deep colors. This is fantastic stuff. If you own a guitar this is the best product out there. But what else can you expect from a US company like Gibson. I was very suprised that it was this effective. This little bottle goes a long way. I have already polished all of my guitars and my friend's guitars and I still have more than 1/2 a bottle left. If you need to polish your guitar look no further. This is your best choice.
