I love this little device:The colors of the display are a nice touch (red on the left hand side and green on the right).The color of the device.The interface is great and the clip works well.It's very accurate and I love how its chromatic function and the fact that it has a very large letter for the chord (versus being hard to read).A very attractive price.  I bought two.  It would be easy to have one for travelling purposes and to leave one at home just in case you lose it.  And it's so cheap, it wouldn't matter if you lost it.
