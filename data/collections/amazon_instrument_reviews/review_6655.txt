Well I love da Fender products, always have always will. I recently built me a nice custom strat, and had been testing out a few of the various mini-tube amps out on the market lately, (which is where I would categorize this amp) even though it has better tubes and more watts. These are my comparison testing amps, (I own both of the 2 amps below and have also tried a number of others in the music store down the road):Blackheart Killer Ant (12" Blackheart cabinet)Vox AC4TV8 4-Watt 8" Compact All-Tube Practice Amp with Celestion VX10 Speaker (also speakered out to the 12" Blackheart cabinet)I've also tested all my amps in various ways by re-tubing them with a number of my collected tubes:Groove TubesJJ TubesSovtek TubesSvetlana TubesTung-Sol Tubes (gold)and straight out of the box, this thing beat them all of in sound quality, even with what a lot of people are calling a cheap Fender speaker version. I also plugged "The Champ" into my 12" Blackheart speaker cabinet and it sounded even better using my strat (but I will do more speaker testing later). Fender amps have always leaned to sounding better with fender guitars, where as Gibson, Epiphone, type guitars really sound pretty good on the Vox and Blackheart models.Now when this amp came out, it was way overpriced but as always that price has fallin into a reasonable range. I mean the price of all of these mini-tube amps are minimal in comparison to the nicer ones, but again this thing is loaded with better guts, so maybe that why it screams better.... ya-hoo, me likey! Better guts, better performance, plus Fender has added an extra range of effects and amp sounds. Its small in size, light in weight, loud and easy to carry with you for jam sessions.
