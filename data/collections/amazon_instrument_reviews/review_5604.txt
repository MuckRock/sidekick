I bought this effect because I saw a few YouTube demos that made it look pretty good. I had always wanted an attack delay effect and the Behringer Slow Motion was priced well below all competitors. When it arrived, I tested it thoroughly and found that it is tricky to learn and limited in scope. It only works well under these circumstances: All notes must be played slowly, individually and deliberately in order for the attack delay effect to kick in. You can't play a quick series of notes and expect the effect to work properly. Having said that, I found that the effect is nice, once you have mastered the technique. I tried to use it in conjunction with overdrive and sustain pedals and it did not work well at all. Other reviewers have suggested using it with a digital or analog delay pedal, which I have not tried. I considered returning the unit to Amazon for a refund, but I don't think that would be fair as it DOES work to some extent and it didn't cost me a lot of money in the first place. However, I do not think I would recommend it to a friend.
