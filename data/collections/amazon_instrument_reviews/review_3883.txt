I was waiting for a flimsy stand to arrive when I ordered something that seemed like it would be for budget price. This stand actually STANDS. I placed my AT2020 with a shock mount and a pop filter on, and while it is heavy, with proper tightening everything stayed in place. And like many other people say, this is a must-have if you have a home studio.
