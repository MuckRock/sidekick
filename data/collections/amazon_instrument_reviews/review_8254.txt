I've tried the Fishman FT-1 and the Tune Tech ttm-201.  I like this one the best.It seems as accurate as my other tuners.  Like all clip on tuners there are "sweet spots" on the head that work better than others.  Oddly the Snark likes different spots from the Fishman or Tune Tech.  I tested the Snark against them, my Korg tuner and my Android App tuner.  The Snark was fine.The biggest plus I see on the Snark and the reason its my new "go to" tuner on the guitar is the large bright screen.  My vision isn't so great in dim light and the clarity and brightness is wonderful.  I don't have to guess or squint.It has a metronome which can be fun.  I personally don't use it because these hearing aid batteries are a bother so I don't want to waste the energy on a metronome and not have the tuning function work when I really need it.The only minus that I can possibly see is that the clamp is pretty fierce.  I don't have a custom made Brazilian rosewood guitar where the headstock could be marked by this thing.  If you do have something expensive check this clip out first to be sure you'll trust it.  If not then the Fishman is more your speed.
