Pop filters already work great to block out wind and other unwanted noises from a microphone. And this with that extra filter on it, it blocks even more. It's simply amazing. Worth the extra few bucks to get the double filter. If I want I can blow directly into the filters and it'll block all wind from the microphone and will only pick up soundwaves.
