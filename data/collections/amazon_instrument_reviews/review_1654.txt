I've used mine on my electric and acoustic guitars and it is easy to use, quick to reposition, frets the strings properly. It is cost effective and looks good. Nice to have a color option, not the usual black that everyone else seems to have.I need a wider one for my 52mm classic guitar's neck that is also flat. This capo cannot work with it.If I lost it, I would definitely get another just like it.
