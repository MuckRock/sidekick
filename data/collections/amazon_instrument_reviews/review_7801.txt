I've been a Fender player since I first picked up the guitar. I've used different strings from D'Darrio to Ernie Ball and now I always use Fender strings. For Stratocasters I always use Super Bullets and for Telecasters I use Super 250s. The only difference between the two is the bullet end vs a ball end on the 250s. The bullet end is designed to give you better tuning stability with the tremolo on a Strat. I don't use the tremolo very much so I don't know how critical it really is for me but since the super bullets cost the same as the super 250s I figure I might as well get the ones that are designed for the Strat. Also, these are the OEM strings that Fender installs at the factory so you can't go wrong with that. I highly recommend them.
