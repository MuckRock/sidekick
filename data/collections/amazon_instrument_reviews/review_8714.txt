This little Guitarlele is great - I have tuned to the standard E tuning of a guitar and it manages very well. It gives a gently subdued tone, that is perfect for playing any time, even accompanying music on the TV whilst the family are watching. I have had way more fun with this little guy in the last couple of weeks than I had with my twelve string in the last six months.Added info:Now that the tuning has settled down, it is keeping tune very well, with no need to retune during playing.The strings it came with are not the best though, they are wearing through all ready.
