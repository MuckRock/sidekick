This small device has amazing quality. The built-in mic records very well compared to those tiny hand-held mono-recorders. Mic gain controls boost volume BUT add some noise (like reviews state) but when used on low-gain, record quite well. Audio-IN records even better when used with good microphones and a mixer (I used a Behringer U-802) for AMAZINGLY clear recordings. Several types of SDHC cards work well and have NOT found a card that did NOT work with this device. Even NiMH (1.2V) batteries can power this, although alkaline (1.5V) last longer.CON: The plastic case is vulnerable to scratches and breakages so treat carefully.
