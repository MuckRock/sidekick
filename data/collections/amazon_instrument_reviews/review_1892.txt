This compressor is a must have for my bass guitar rig and is used often in my other musicians' electric guitar rigs. It's very basic - two controls and one toggle - but gives quite a bit of punch and allows for a much stronger signal. Both my jazz bass and my Precision Bass sound great through this pedal.
