I tried the Dean Markley Blue Steel Light accoustic strings on my Takamine guitar, and will soon replace them.  On quality control, the high E steel string in the set looks bad with dark spots on it, two of which show after stringing the guitar.  String did not break as I rather expected, but it looks bad.  On sound, these seemed okay at first, but I still find it hard to keep in tune after a week, especially the high B and E steel strings, which just don't sound that good to me.  And I find the low E wound string notes tend to be too high as I move up the neck, more so than other sets I have used.Guess I'll go back to D'Addario and Ernie Ball.
