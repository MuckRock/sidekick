Yes, it's cheap plastic.  Yes, the battery life is very short as this unit sucks the life out of a battery in a couple of hours.  Yes, the battery is difficult to replace.  However, this is the best sounding cheap reverb pedal on the planet.  I solved the battery problem by using a 1-Spot 8-outlet pedal power supply.  It doesn't sound nearly as cheap as its construction or price might suggest.  Everything from simulated spring reverb to endless caverns is here, and it all sounds great.  It even has a "modulated" reverb, which is a reverb with a slight flange/chorus affecting the reverb signal only (not the dry signal) which is their version of the Holy Grail's "Flerb" setting.  This is about 1/3 the cost of the Holy Grail, and the foot switch should hold up well under normal stage use (unless of course, you are an elephant).  For all the complaining I hear about this and other pedals with "cheap plastic cases", I have yet to hear about anyone actually breaking one while using it.  Behringer pedals are hit and miss, but this one is certainly a hit.
