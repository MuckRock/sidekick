I have these on 5 of my guitars now, with my acoustic and a &#34;novelty&#34; guitar being the exceptions. I can't stand the thought of not using these after seeing too many expensive guitars hit the floor after the straps let loose. Other styles have a button, which seems more convenient, but the Schaller locks are pull style which is far more secure if something bumps the end of the lock. These are the only locks I'll use now.
