It definitely changes the sound of my Classical Guitar for the better (Pavan TP-30).  It allows the the bass notes to have distinct upper note harmonics/partials and it takes away the boominess of the fundamental.  My initial thought was that it did away with the "blurriness" of the low bass to mid-range response and balanced the entire spectrum of the guitar's range.  Amazing what a $20 piece plastic can do.  Highly recommended.
