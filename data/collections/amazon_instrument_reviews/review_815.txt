i've used pick when i play most of time and i used white color thinnest one. i like to use thin ones because i play strumming most of time and this one works perfect. very easy to grip and last long. one thing to point out is that print on pick fades away very quickly but i do not mind. highly recommand this for anyone needs pick!
