Got this to put into my Pseudo-caster project guitar. Love it! Be warned, it does NOT come with springs, claw or trem bar. If you order this, get the tremolo bar for the Mexican model. The threads are smaller on these.If you like to do &#34;dive bombs&#34;, you will need to grind a bevel on a small portion this massive sustain block. It will hit the back of the cavity before getting anywhere near absolute floppiness.Last important note... Make sure you measure your outer pivot screw distance. If it matches spec on this Trem, all the screw holes will match up.
