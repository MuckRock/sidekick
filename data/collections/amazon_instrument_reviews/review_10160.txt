First off this is a overdrive pedal with a MOSFET circuit engineered to sound like overdriven tube distortion. The pedal is very good at this. There are a lot of tones available but fully cranked through a large amp, this is on par with the warm tone of another EHX pedal, the Big Muff Fuzz. The tone function is kindof useless to me I like to keep it on, With the switch turned on the effect is a little too harsh. Don't let that keep you from checking this hot rod out. I love mine. Its a keeper.
