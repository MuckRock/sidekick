It's a very fair price and is made well.  It seems as though it will hold up to some kicking around.  The only thing that worries me is that once the bottom piece swiveled and dropped my guitar...and this was when I just set it down not a few seconds before it fell.  I'd recommend easing your guitar into place and making sure it's secure.  I'm not sure how &#34;on stage&#34; ready this is.  It's a good, cheap stand though and for the price point, I understand the sacrifices they made in the design.
