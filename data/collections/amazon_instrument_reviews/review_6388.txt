My home practice area is in a rather dark corner with limited room, and I have this clipped onto my music stand. Illuminates the music far better than the previous ones I had used, including one that used a full sized bulb (rather too much light and not very portable). Have no trouble that others have mentioned, just it loses a star because the included ac adapter cord is *short*, making it for all intents and purposes useless to me without having to string along an extension cord to my music stand (ugh, more cords).
