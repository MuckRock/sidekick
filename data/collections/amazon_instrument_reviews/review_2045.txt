Purchased two of these to hang up guitars at home.  I saw them used in a guitar shop so I assumed they were more than sufficient for use at home. I'm using them with both acoustic and electric guitars. They appear to be designed to hang the guitar away from the wall to avoid abrasions on the back and they do just that. The hooks can be stretched apart or squeezed together to fit the headstock of the guitar.  Overall, they are attractive, well-made hangars.
