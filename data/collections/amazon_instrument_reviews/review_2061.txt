I purchased this model for home use--not for a kid's backpack. It's solid and sturdy, easily holding a song book open--not just a few pieces of sheet music. It adjusts tall enough for standing as well as low enough to sit next to my easy chair in the evening. I often clip on a digital recorder for practice and have no threat of the top flipping down. Works for me!
