I use this to record vocals and acoustic guitar on my iMac.  The simplicity of this mic is very nice.  The sound quality is also very decent.  I haven't ever used one of those 'professional' quality ones but this has not disappointed me so far.  The only complaint I have is that there is no 'On/Off' switch.  The only way to turn it off is to unplug it.  Other than that I totally recommend this Microphone!
