This thing has so many uses its ridiculous.  I mostly use it to record live band rehearsals, and it's pretty amazing at that.  I've also recorded interview audio and most recently used it as a USB interface for my DAW when my other interface went kaput.  If you are using this for film, music, field recording you will be very happy.  Easy to use interface and very well constructed.
