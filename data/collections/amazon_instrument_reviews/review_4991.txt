For anyone who has had the experience of a strap coming off at the most inopportune time and seeing your baby go crashing to the floor only once, is enough to justify a strap lock system of some kind. I mount my guitars on the wall when they are not being used, so I wanted a strap that can be put on and taken off easily. Anyone who removes and reinstalls their strap knows that it does not take long for those eye holes to become loose. Also, I didn't want to have short &#34; strapletts&#34; dangling from my guitars while it's being displayed. So for the couple bucks they cost and 10 minutes, I get everything I wanted. Quick release and reattach of the strap, the piece of mind that it's not going to just randomly drop one day, And they come in all the standard finishes, chrome, black, gold, nickle and they do not detract from the visual artistry of the guitar while on display. I have these on all my guitars and always will. As an added bonus, once you have these on multiple guitars, you can quickly swap out straps as often as you change your underwear.
