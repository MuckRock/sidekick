This thing works wonders. If you are anyone who performs live or just someone who happens to switch between channels alot I recommend. I hate having to let go of the guitar to switch channels, and this just is perfect for the job. The pedals are all easy to press and I love the volume/wah 2-in-1 pedal. I just use it as a volume, because I already have a wah pedal. The tuner works amazing as well. I also love the fact that it connects to your amp via RJ45 ethernet cable.
