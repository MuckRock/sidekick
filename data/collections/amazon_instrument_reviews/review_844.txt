I use the Dunlop .60mm nylon picks as my current standard,  but decided to give the lighter .38mm a try.  Unfortunately,  the volume they produce get completely swallowed up when accompanying singing with an acoustic guitar (especially in an outdoor picnic setting),  and basically unusable for that purpose.  However, I did find these were just the ticket for personal practice, allowing me to hear a  metronome or backtrack far easier.  So although they failed my original performance intention, 5 stars for filling a need I didn't even know I had.  :)
