I wanted to add a chorus to my effects chain and since I have mostly Behringer products (and am more than satisfied with my other pedals) decided to try the CO400. Again I am more than satisfied. A chorus isn't something you use all the time so I expect this one to give me years of good Behringer reliability and service. For someone looking for that extra color in your sound  try this pedal.I think you'll be pleasantly surprised and you sure can't beat the price. A great value for your money.
