We have used them for three shows and a bunch of practices. Sounds great, looks great, the cable tie straps are nice and the connectors fit into the microphone nice and tight. Even fixed another bands vox mic connector, his sure cable was loose in the connector, this cable was tight. Has worked on...SM57, Nady Starpower, AKG 5800s, MXL 990, Marshall and Mark bass amps, and every one had a nice tight clean connection on the XLR's and on the numerous mixers. And yes COLOR RULES!
