Our second week and all is WELL! Nice and quiet. Using Speakon Cables (Mono) to each Speaker to Speaker for easy mixing. XLR to XLR from Mackie Mixer to PylePRO 1400 Watt amp. Great value for the Garage Band and recording to the computer for publishing on Web or using as a small GIG amp. Think I will get another one for the Stage Monitors. Might as well go ALL-IN!
