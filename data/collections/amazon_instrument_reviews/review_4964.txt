This is an awesome way to get into the in ear monitor game without dropping hundreds of dollars. Adjust your volume of the main mix, and adjust your instrument/mic level relative to the mix without affecting the main sound or your band mates feeds. Perfect for that singer or musician who is constantly asking for &#34;more me&#34; in their monitor. You can also use this to control a floor monitor if you want.
