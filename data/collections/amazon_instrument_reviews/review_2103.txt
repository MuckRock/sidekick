Some say "daw-dare-e-o", "de-ah-dare-e-o", "dad-ar-ee-oh", or "dee-ah-dare-e-o"Others shorten it to "D-adds" or even "Daddy-O's".  Took me a while to figure that last one out.I was trying to find out info about "Daddy-O strings" and why people thought they were so great.  Duh.While people may disagree on how to say the name, few debate the idea that these are great strings.* Less expensive that most string sets out there, especially if you buy multi-packs* Color-coded to make string changes easy* Easy to find from most any vendor or music store* Made in the USA* You can collect "players points" for SWAG* They are sealed in a special "environmentally friendly" package to keep them fresh and corrosion-free* They have one of the widest range of string-size combinations availableIf you are just starting out and do not know what to put on your new guitar then the phrase "set it up with EXL-120s" or "put on some Da-Dairy-O" nines" is a good choice, at least for a strat or tele-like guitar.I personally like them better than Ernie Ball Super Slinkys aka "EB Pinks", but I cannot quite put my finger on "why".You can pay more for coated strings, cryogenic frozen strings, boutique strings, and all that but if you do not know what any of those are then you probably haven't been playing long enough to find value in them.Almost every guitarist has a set of strings they "swear by" because they work wonders that no other string can - they make them play smoother or faster, their last set of strings lasted for 6 years, or whatever.I just appreciate a great value, and D'Addario strings are just that.BTW, for the record the official pronunciation is "Da-Dairy-O":>> "We receive letters each week regarding the correct pronunciation of the D'Addario name. Some years back, we even ran an ad that illustrated an easy way to pronounce the D'Addario name. The name is pronounced phonetically as follows: Da-Dairy-O. A simple way to pronounce the most difficult name in musical accessories!"
