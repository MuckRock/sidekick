I like this pedal.  Its rugged and has a great range of tonal capabilities and rips for hardcore metal.  That being said, the blue LED while cool looking is actually blinding and I found myself placing a finger over it to just see the friggin' knobs for adjustments.  I guess that is a pretty weak complaint but IMO it's an impediment more than an enhancement.  Also the Gate and Scoop buttons feels pretty flimsy to me... which is not expected at this price point.  A moot point because I am not using the Gate at least as IMO it was &#34;weird&#34; in its Gating execution, sounded kind of like a very rough algorithm is being used instead of a nice smooth curve.  But all in all this thing tears it up in terms of pure shredding tone.
