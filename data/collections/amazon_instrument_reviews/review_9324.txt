I have owned two Snark headstock tuners (the blue ones). They are great products but I find one thing about them absolutely infuriating: the design of the "ball joint" that connects the tuner to the clip. Both of my Snarks have broken off at this joint. I am a home player - I do not put the tuners under any type of stress.This Fender tuner is a great alternative. The way the tuner connects to the clip is much more sturdy than a Snark. However, as others have mentioned, this Fender tuner display can not rotate as freely as a Snark. So, for live usage it may prove difficult depending on how it is oriented. However, for the home player, this tuner will work just fine.The tuner itself is much smaller than I thought it would be. It is smaller than a Snark (but not by much). The clip works well with a PRS headstock, which does not have a lot of free real estate compared to a Strat style headstock.The only real negative I see is to change the battery (and to put the first battery in) requires the use of a very, very small phillips head screwdriver. I build computers so I had one handy, but I would guess some people probably dont have a screwdriver small enough to do the job on hand.
