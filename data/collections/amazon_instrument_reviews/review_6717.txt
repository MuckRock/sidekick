Nothing special here. If you don't like doing the shoelace thing with your acoustic guitar strap, and you don't want to bore a hole in the heel, then this is a nice compromise. There are slits on both ends of the leather, which means you can reverse the button if you don't want the logo on the front of the guitar neck/headstock. You could even flip it inside-out and have the soft leather side exposed. I subtracted a star because I think the button should be made out of metal instead of plastic.
