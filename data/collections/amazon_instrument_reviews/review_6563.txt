I guess I have tried about every type of pick around. Thick ridged things with thin strumming edges, great big triangles oh do you remember cork circles on one side? Look this is just easy, the star hole means I grip it and it doesn't move until I let go. Never had one break and the gauge being marked is so much nicer than digging through the "pick pen" on the counter of the local music store trying to find 3 that feel right. Yup 3 'cause they were three for $1.00
