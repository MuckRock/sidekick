This little device is more than worth the money.  I run a Behringer EUROPOWER PMP1280S Powered Mixer into the Behringer 1202 12 channel desktop mixer($80)into the UCA202 into my computer.  The recording is awesome.  My recording playback sounds like its live.I use a lot of Behringer equipment and no, I don't work for Behringer.  I'm on a budget.  That means little money.My friends say, "Duh, oh, well, Behringer is built cheap and is junk."  And I say, "Duh, huh, really?  I've got better sound than you, a lot more equipment to power my show, it has never broken down, and I paid a LOT less than you did."In fact, I use Behringer XM8500 mics ( 3 pack for $60 ).  I was playing a gig at a small pub.  A friend who swears by Sure mics asked if he could do a song on my break.  I said sure.  When he was done, he said, I LOVE this mic.  The sound is awesome.  Nuff said.
