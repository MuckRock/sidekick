This is a great case that came TWO WEEKS earlier than the arrival date. In came in good packaging and I found no flaws when inspecting it. My Jasmine fits snugly inside of it, no bumping whenever I carry the case. The only problem I have is it smells terrible! But that's fine; I just left it open on the deck for two days and the smell is not noticeable. Other than that, this was a great investment!
