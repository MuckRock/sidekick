I got this because at just around 32 bucks, its pretty much seemed like a stealcompared to other pedals I was looking at.But a few notes..If you buy this, definitely have/buy a 9v adapter with a (-) polarity.Also know that when people said that little blue light was blinding, well,they weren't kidding. I've put a little paper and tape over mine as well, however it isn't sticking.It might not have the best effects or effect strength, but as my amp has no built in effects, its better than nothing.If you're cheap like me but want effects, this is decent, although the chorus effect seems particularly weak.
