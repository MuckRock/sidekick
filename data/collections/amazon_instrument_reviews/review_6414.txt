I'm very satisfied with the performance of the CM-2.  With a few tweaking, I could emulate the sound I get from my Fulltone OCD.  I'd say it's very versatile because there are two seperate controls for low & high frequencies unlike most pedals with just the "Tone" control.  A toggle switch lets you choose between "classic" & "modified" setting.  A tweaker's delight!  The "level" knob has a lot of juice.  If you set it at 10 or 11 o'clock, it's plenty loud enough.  Although you can't use it as a clean boost because it gives off a little gain even if you set the "gain" knob to zero.  If you have a single coil, it may sound like your tube amp is just breaking up, not so for humbuckers (too much gain).  You can also stack the CM-2 with other pedals.  I dusted my old Boss DS-1 and run it along with the CM-2 and was able to get some good tones.  The DS-1 usually hurts my ears but with the CM-2 behind it, sweet!  The Hardwire CM-2 may not be exotic as the boutique offerings from Klon, Zvex or LovePedal, but it will get the job done at a significantly lower cost.  It's well built, will take the pounding a gigging musician will subject it to.  There may be others better but they cost more than twice the price but not twice as good.  Try it, you can't go wrong!UPDATE:  Did a full comparison between the CM-2, Fulltone OCD & Joyo Crunch Distortion.GAIN:  Joyo obviously has the most gain followed closely by the CM-2 and OCD, 3rd.MIX:  The CM-2 has the most amount of control with separate high & low controls, followed by the OCD with just a tone control and the Joyo Crunch more or less sounds the same no matter what position you put the tone control.  Since the CM-2 has the widest tone range, I can make it behave like a Treble Booster!NUANCE:  The OCD cleans up well when you roll down the volume control on your guitar and is very dynamic.  The CM-2 is a close second and the Joyo Crunch, being strictly a distortion pedal is far behind.
