I was hoping the Lemon oil would be what I needed to get that crud off some of my guitar fingerboards but, it's not very good at that. I suggest cleaning with a detergent first and then let it dry. Once clean, the lemon oil does a good job of sealing the wood - even where years of playing have taken their toll. It's a good finish but, not the place to start. The product is not meant to be used on maple. Don't know why but, not an issue since most of my instruments are rosewood or other dark, exotic woods. So far, so good.
