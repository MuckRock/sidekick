GREAT WORK MAT FOR ELECTRIC AND ACOUSTIC GUITARS AS WELL AS BASS AND STAYS AT MY WORKBENCH.  HOWEVER, I NEVER LEAVE IT ROLLED OUT UNLESS WORKING ON A GUITAR, TO MANY OTHER STRAY FRAGMENTS OF WHO KNOWS WHAT FLOATING AROUND IN MY WORKSHOP AND I DON'T WANT ANYTHING FALLING ON MAT THAT COULD POTENTIAL SCRATCH ONE OF MY BABIES!
