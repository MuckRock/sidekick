I've played the guitar for a number of years, some of them professionally, and during that time I've owned guitars by Fender, Gibson, Ovation, B.C. Rich, Yamaha and Applause. That said, admittedly, this guitar was purchased with the intention of it being a cheap, expendable guitar that was reasonably playable, that I could take with me when I go camping. While my expectations weren't all that high due to guitar's price, upon reading other reviews and having experienced Takamine's quality, I decided to gave this Jasmine a try.  I'm glad I did - what a nice guitar it turned out to be! Out of the box, the fit and matte finish were impressive. The neck action was nicely set up, the intonation is spot-on and the guitar has a rich sound and tone.  The tuning pegs work smoothly and the guitar stays in tune nicely.  Note that I changed strings from the set provided to a set of extra-light gauge strings just as a personal preference and that the guitar features a black pick guard not shown in some product photos. The Jasmine S34C NEX is truly an impressive guitar for the price.
