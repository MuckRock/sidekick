Yes, this pedal is made of plastic. Yes it is inexpensive. But don't be fooled- unless you really mash on the switch button like an idiot, or over torque the battery cover screw too hard with a screw driver and strip out the plastic threads- it is pretty tough and durable. The chorus effect has plenty of adjustment, tone, and depth. It may not be a Boss pedal, but for $15.99 you are getting a tremendous value and it sounds very good. I was so impressed with these inexpensive pedals I now own 4 or 5 of them. As a hobbyist guitar player who does not want to invest hundreds of dollars into multiple effects pedals- I am into 4 or 5 of them PLUS associated cables and a power adapter for about the same amount than I could buy ONE Boss or other high quality pedal for.I would also recommend buying the Danelectrode 9V power adapter if you use multiple pedals. You can also buy a 5 gang power cable and daisy chain up to 4 or 5 pedals from the same power supply to make your own pedal board. If you have multiple Danelectro pedals it is a clean way to tie them together. I also bought some short 6 inch instrument cables and daisy chained the pedal inputs/outputs together so I can have mixed effects, or have each one independently.These pedals have been used almost daily for a couple of months now and I have not had one issue with any to date. A few other guitar player friends that have tried mine out are also very impressed by them. Absolutely a 5 star value!
