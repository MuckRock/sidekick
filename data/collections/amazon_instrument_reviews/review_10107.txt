I've tried numerous stands for the variety of instruments I use: electric guitar, acoustic guitar, mandolin, violin, and banjo. This one fits all of them and holds them securely and folds up easily for transport. It doesn't get in the way, has rubber feet and padding, and just works simply and effectively. It's not flashy looking, but then it's never seen because it either is hidden by the instrument, or blends in because of its compact size and black color. Nothing else is as versatile and effective, including the multi instrument stands, the ones with other shapes of the support arms, and other folding designs. This is simply the ideal.
