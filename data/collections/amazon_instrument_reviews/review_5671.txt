For what it's supposed to do, it works very well. I also have the medium size and that one fits a bit better I think. This is still usable, but it is for very big fingers. I think I have slightly fatter fingers than the average guy out there, but this still leaves some extra room. Either way, it works well. It feels very sturdy and I'm not worried about it cracking anytime soon. For the price, it's a must have.
