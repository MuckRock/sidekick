I ordered three of these ...so far!Very affordable and good quality. Made in Canada.Keeps wireless unit very snug and tight.Easy in and out with Velcro retaining strap. (all leather.)I use the little plastic flat ring on the bottom to loop my strap through which keeps it tight against the guitar strap.The width of the slots are 1 inch and 1/16&#34; or approximately 27 mm wide. The leather will bend a little to allow a slightly larger and tighter fit.These are much better than I suspected and have a few expensive Levy's classic padded straps. They fit each other like a glove and are very high quality without getting ridiculous or gawdy.If you click on the item and go to the product page I have uploaded some photos of actual use and close-ups.
