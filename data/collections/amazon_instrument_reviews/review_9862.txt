I have a bad habit of backing off of the microphone when changing chords on the guitar. This little device gives me auto-correct for that habit as well as some nice echos and reverbs which aren't overbearing, and the pitch correction sounds really natural. Now I just need 2 more so the rest of our singers have that same great sound.
