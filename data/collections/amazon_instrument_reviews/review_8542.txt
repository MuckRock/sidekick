I was a bit skeptical about the quality of the guitar when I was thinking about buying it, but I read all the review on it and decided to give a shot.  I figured for the price ($39.99 in late Nov 2012) that it wouldn't be a big deal if it was a crap guitar because I bought it to play around with while I visit my family in CA.  When I opened it, I was pleasantly surprised!The guitar came in great shape.  It was packed well and didn't have any damage on it.  The top fret on the fretboard has some extra glue on it, but it doesn't affect the performance of the guitar.  It came with an allen wrench to adjust the trust rod and once I lowered the action on the guitar, it was much easier to play.The sound is excellent even with the strings they provide which seem like medium weight.  Overall, I'm extremely pleased with my purchase.  It sounds as good or better as my old school ovation that cost three times as much.  The pick guard looks a bit cheap, but that's just nitpicking.If you want a cheap guitar that sounds great, I totally recommend this one.  I am extremely happy with this purchase.
