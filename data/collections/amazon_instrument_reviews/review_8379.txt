This is the second clip on tuner I have bought. This is much better than the other brand I have. It's easy to use and see. The colors and the swivel head make this one my favorite. The built in tap metronome is a cool idea. If you're shopping for a tuner give this a try. At less than $13 it's a fantastic buy
