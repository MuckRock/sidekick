Love the very fast tracking,  So convienient to have a cheap but amazing tuner on each of my guitars!  For $10 bux each,  why not???  The screen articulates so there is always a perfect view,  I am finding myself making much more minor adjustments to my tuning than I used to just because its right there and so convienient,  so my playing sounds better than ever before simply because I am always in perfect tune now!  Way better than digging out the tuner from the case in the closet, finding a expensive 9 volt battery, selecting a note you want to tune and  waiting for a needle to stop moving on  my crappy old tuner.  Just an amazing product,  I even clipped it onto my piano and bought a $30 set of tools online and saved $100 tuning my piano myself!!!
