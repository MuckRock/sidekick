After 35 years of buying stands all I can say is that I should have invented it myself. I have many expensive guitars and I wouldn't use a inexpensive stand before I found this design. So if you're shopping and wonder if it's really good, you can trust me, because I'm way over qualified to pass judgement on this and I care about guitars and about Amazon shoppers.
