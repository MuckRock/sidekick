I love my Levy's Jacquard Straps.  They are colourful.  I have purchase 2 to see how they were.  This one to match with my black Ovation 1861- Balladeer and another to match with my Ovation Maple top CC44.  I now have another one for my new Ovation 12 String CC245 just ordered this week from Amazon.The straps were chosen to match with the guitar colours and my wife thinks that they are awesome and will certainly be talked about by the ladies around when I play my guitars.They tightly fit around the guitar buttons and the shoulders.  I have no regrets with the purchases and I truly recommend those straps to anyone.
