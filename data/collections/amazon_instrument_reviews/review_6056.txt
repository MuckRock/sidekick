I use these on my Fender Strat, and they sound great. If you appreciate the talent of David Gilmour, and respect his taste and choices in music, than I would recommend these strings. I used to use Elixir strings, and as great as Elixir sound, they do not last long. These do. I have played guitar for over 30 years, and I am very happy with these strings.
