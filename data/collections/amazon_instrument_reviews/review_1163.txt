I think they did it right splitting the light and medium gauges. What resulted for me was the perfect gauge string. They almost sound as good as mediums but feature the playability of lights. I also think these strings last a decent amount of time, particularly if you wipe your strings after playing (which I need to get better at doing). Bottom line: I highly recommend these; they are the strings that I use and have been using for several years now.
