On the plus side it does the job, powers your 9V pedals and doesn't break the bank...on the down side this unit can be a bit noisy depending on which wall socket you have to plug into. Neon lighting can raise Hell with this power supply...but who ever said playing out live was gonna be easy? Best to have a noise gate handy...just in case.
