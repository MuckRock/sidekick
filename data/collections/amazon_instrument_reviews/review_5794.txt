I just got this and love it.  My Fender Stratocaster fits perfectly into the bag, padded well too.  I can fit all of my &#34;stuff&#34; into the MANY pockets as well.  This bag is amazing and nothing like what I expected for the price I paid.  It has shoulder straps to carry the bag and contents on my back and also has a large loop to hang the bag on a door or hook too.  If you need a bag to protect your fender and to carry you stuff in, buy this one.  I LOVE IT.  I would expect to pay a hundred bucks for this kind of quality but only spent 30 bucks.
