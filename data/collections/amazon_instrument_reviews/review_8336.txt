Extreamly easy to use, you can tune any instrumet witn this.  The display is bright and clear, easy to see in the dark.  You can tune by sound with the microphone or by vibration; the clip is excellent to hold it to the instrument.  The price couldn't be better, I just can't believe how come people purchase a lot more expensive tuners when this excellent product exists.
