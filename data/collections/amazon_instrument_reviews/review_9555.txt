As a gigging musician and guitar player for over 25 years I am always in the hunt for something different. I love Fenders especially telecasters (I love the simplicity of two pickups, two knobs, and a p-up selector). I wanted something with P-90s and have been impressed with budget level guitars as of late. You can get a lot more for your money these days.I pulled the trigger on one of these Les Paul Special P-90 by Epi and have been really impressed. I actually bought it as a modification platform but as of yet, I can't really think of anything to change.Pros - Simple, TV yellow is great looking with wood grain showing through, Shorter scale has that familiar Les Paul feel. Sounds KILLER through my tube amps (Peavey Classic 30 and 50, Fender Blues Jr.), lightweight, stays in tune, cheap price (not afraid to take it out to a gig, not afraid to have it stolen, let my kids play it, etc.), comfortable neck profile.Cons - Cheap tuners (but stay in tune), cheap electronics (wiring), some frets are long and sharp (my high E string gets caught under the 14th/15th fret - I haven't filed it yet), messy job at nut and fret board.All in all, this is a great guitar for a great price. I still plan on modding it, but as it stands it is perfect with all its imperfections. My upgrades, if any, will be new pots, caps, wiring, nut, perhaps tuners. No need to replace these pickups. You get to a certain point of diminishing returns when modding a cheap guitar like this. At a certain point your cost of upgrades will exceed the cost of the instrument.As a bit of a guitar snob (love my US Fenders) this guitar is getting a lot of action. I say this one just may be a keeper.
