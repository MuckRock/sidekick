Nice Polish/cleaner  Really works very well on the finishes I have (cheap glossy chinese electrics, and a matte finish acoustic).  handy to have when your changing strings (to clean that nasty fretboard- wow do those things get dirty!) Pleasant scent (lemon oil), and no residue.  Lasts a long time (2 or 3 squirts will do an entire guitar.
