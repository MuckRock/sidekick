Put this through an AC30C2 and prepare to be amazed. Never owned an OCD but I don't need to. My neighbors I'm sure are not pleased. Many have decribed this pedal and there is nothing else like it at this price point! It's your guitar on steriods. Crisp deplication of it with bass, treble and a little hair on it. That's at the 25% gain setting. Flip from low to high micro switch and hold on to your balls. From nasty blues to Steppenwolf you will have it covered.
