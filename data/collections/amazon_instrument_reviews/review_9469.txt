It's hard to find a good clip-on tuner that's accurate and visible in all situations. The Snark SN-8(B) is my favorite so far.  It's really bright, more accurate that other Snarks, and (despite other reviews saying it breaks easily) I've found it to be sturdy enough considering how flexible it is.  Again, it's a clip-on tuner so don't expect razor-sharp accuracy.  But it does a good enough job for what it is.  It's quick and convenient.  If you need something more accurate I recommend investing in a good pedal.  I've found the swivel to be a nice feature that makes it easy to see the display.  I don't typically use the metronome feature, but it's nice to have it.  Overall, my favorite Snark model and my favorite clip-on tuner.
