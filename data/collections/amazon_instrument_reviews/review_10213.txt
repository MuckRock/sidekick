I installed these on a Fender Jazz bass with active electronics. After stringing them up & tuning I immediately noticed how really sharp they sounded. I play finger style and they really added a clear definition to each note played. They sounded great all up & down the fret board. Where I really noticed the difference was in recording. Been working on a new batch of songs and a the bass to the songs on the recordings made after these strings is noticeably superior to the ones made before. Except for the songs with acoustic bass I will be going back and re recording the bass parts to the songs made before I installed these strings. I  don't play slap or pick bass so I can't say how well they work for those styles but for my purpose they come very highly recommended.
