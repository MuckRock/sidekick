These tuning machines are great.They are a little heavier than the stock tuners on my guitars but they help keep your guitar in tune as intended.I needed the tuners replaced on an Applause (Ovation copy) guitar (the bushings fell out of one of the tuners and it became really floppy and refused to stay in tune)and a Washburn guitar. They fit on my Washburn and my Applause perfectly with zero need to ream or drill.The tuner hole size is .391 or 25/64 and of course if your hole size is smaller you must either use a drill or tuner reamer (yes a tuner reamer is a real tool just look at a place like Stewart MacDonald). You may be required to pre-drill for the screws that go through the back of the tuner.It is only one hole and very small.The vendor was quick in sending these tuners but there was no way to trace the package and it became difficult to receive it due to the fact it had to be signed for.The run around at the post office of getting it re-sent was ridiculous.The vendor should try to provide a tracking number so customers can avoid all of the back and forth and have an estimate as to when the package will arrive.
