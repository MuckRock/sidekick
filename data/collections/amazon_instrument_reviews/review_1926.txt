One of my conventional booms just broke because of cheap plastic parts that couldn't handle the stress of being tightened repeatedly.  I came across these and after reading the reviews figured I didn't have much to lose with a $7 price tag.  I was very glad I made the purchase and I'm going to order a couple more of this model and the 13" model.  It's steel construction except for the oversized nylon knob used to adjust the angle and hold the boom in place.  It's solidly built and I don't imagine it will break easily.  The two pieces that move against each other have teeth, so once the angle is set and the knob tightened, it will not slip.  Get the 13" if you want to reach amps sitting on the floor from a conventional stand.  7" is great because it allows you to sing with an acoustic guitar without the extra length.
