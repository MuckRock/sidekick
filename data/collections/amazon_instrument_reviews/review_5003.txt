I ordered these tuners for my Fender Blacktop Stratocaster (MIM). I just received these tuning machines today ... the pegs line up, so they drop right in. Remember ... the E-A-D are that tall capstans and the G-B-E are the shorter capstans ... it all works out. I've also put 5 springs in the block (I like stiff tremelo, bridge flush to surface) and replaced the amplifier knobs with conventional Strat knobs (had to get CTS split-shaft 500K pots for that and replace the solid shaft pots). The amp knobs they use get in the way of the tremelo bar. BUT, back to the tuners ... they just made this guitar perfect with holding tuning. Much easier and faster to change strings.I just ordered another set for my Strat H-S-S ... great guitar but could certainly use these tuners.
