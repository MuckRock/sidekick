Replaced a stock fender speaker in a modified Mustang Lead II cabinet that I now use connected to a Hughes and Kettner amp.  This speaker dramatically improved the sound of the cabinet, and sounded good using the Mustang II amp as well.  This speaker seems to take some of the sizzle and shrill off the high-end to make a nice even sound.  I'm quite pleased with this speaker.
