Consider the distortion sound of Cream, the Doors, and ZZ top.  That buzzy, psychedelic type sound is what this pedal does.  Unfortunately, that's about all it does.  However, if you want to have the perfect "break on through" guitar intro sound, this is absolutely the pedal for you.  Quality-wise it's awesome, and if I needed that sound I would definitely own one again.  I got rid of mine to purchase some other gear that served a wider variety of functions, and honestly I haven't missed it, because I'm not in a Doors cover band or anything.
