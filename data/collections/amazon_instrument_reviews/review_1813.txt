I recently sent two of my Ovations back to the factory in Connecticut for re-work (I just plain wore them out), and they came back to me with these strings on them.  As soon as I took them out of their case and strummed them, I immediately called the factory and said "thanks for the fantastic job on these guitars, and by the way, these are the best sounding strings I've ever played, what exactly are they?"  I might experiment with the EXP15s, but by and large, these EXPs are my new strings.
