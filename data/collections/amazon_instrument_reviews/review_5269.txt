I had to make some adjustments on the neck of my Martin d-28 and remove the bridge pickup. This left the saddle too low to the neck.  I researched the "Tusq" products and found enough people impressed to give it a try.  I'm pleased to say I find more ring through the body and a better sustain.  I'll do this to my other acoustics as time goes on.
