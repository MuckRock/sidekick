I will no longer use other humidifying methods for my BR-243A. There's too much that can go wrong with over or under humidifying a solid wood acoustic guitar. Woods swell and shrink based on moisture vapor and it can also affect the tone quality.The beauty of these is that the gel packs maintain consistent humidity and make any changes gradually.
