Purchased this cord to help set up mic for some band recording at home.  The cable is great because it's long enough to allow us to move our mic where we need it.  I got this item much quicker than I expected.  The shipping was fast and the product was in perfect condition.  Seller is A+ in my book.  If we need more of this type of equipment would certainly buy from them again.
