I bought this to replace the inexpensive Musedo T-50 tuner that came bundled with my Kala KA-S ukulele. The Snark SN-2 is much more accurate, but its LCD display is not very bright, and has a narrow field of view. (Yes, I did try a fresh battery, but it made no difference.) I wish it were brighter and easier to see. Still, it's a very good tuner overall.
