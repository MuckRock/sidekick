Being a studio owner I didn't buy this for stage work. Being a player of multiple stringed instruments for decades I've had many different tuners including real strobes. So when I picked this up about 8 months ago it was because I needed one where I was at and right now.I don't know about the +/- .1% accuracy but the pegs and my ear tell me it's quite accurate, enough that I can find notes up and down the neck that are slightest bit out of tune when using it. By using a transformer adapter and a stage mic it also works very well for acoustic instruments.I'm still using the replacement battery I put in about 6 months ago but I just use it and unplug. It's travelled with me a few times and airport security finds it an interesting thing for me to have in a carry on but it almost seems durable enough to drop from 35,000 feet and continue working.I was shocked by how well it works. I was shocked by the fact that I could spend so little and get a real tuner and not a device that gets you close. Highly recommended.
