I just installed these on my Chibson LP from overseas. I had to rout out the holes a bit and make them ever so slightly larger.. I took a slightly larger drill bit and turned it backwards, not forwards, by hand slowly, until it was perfect. I also put some blue masking tape on the headstock just in case I slipped. Took me about 1.5 hours.The ones that came with my guitar were really close to these in appearance. Really close, but they were terrible in operation. I have no problems spending the 50 on these to improve the guitar. Haven't played them yet, but all the reviews were good, so here goes.....Update:  Played for a couple hours. First thing I notice is that they are geared lower than the old Chibsons and the other tuners on my other guitars.. You tune it a full turn, and the tune moves up slightly. Which is plenty of nice fine tuning adjustment.This fixed the Chibson tuning issue. I'll order another set for my other Chibson.Also, I have two Epiphones. I believe these are nicer than the Epi's.So I bought based solely on the reviews here. I wasn't disappointed. In fact, I am pretty impressed. good replacement for "iffy" tuners. They worked for me...
