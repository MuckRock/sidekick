The title says it all.  Great performance, sub par construction.  I bought this pedal for the compression and sustain, though, and am very pleased.  I use it for both bass and guitar, and it processes the signals well.  I am sure it would work well for other instruments or on recordings also.  Cheaply made, though.  I removed a spring that was seemingly attached to nothing inside the unit.  The removal stopped a terrible clicking noise that would have been audible from the stage floor.  Plastic encasement means the unit will likely suffer noticeable wear and tear throughout its lifetime.  Wish it was better made.  Audio reproduction is great!
