I'm a very big fan of David Gilmour but never was a fan of GHS's. So I thought I'm wanting to step up one gauge to 10's so why not try these. It took a little longer for them to get stable but My Strat and My Les Paul sound and feel Great. Now , ( and I didn't see this at first ) on David's Les Paul , He use's 10.5's and I have a Bigsby on Mine like His. I may try those next time on My Les Paul. I'm not sure how they will work on a Epiphone Les Paul 'cause I have a Gibson and there is a BIG diference. And on the MIM's Fender's either cause both of mine are American Standards. All in all I'm very pleased with the DG GHS's....
