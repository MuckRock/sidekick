If you're looking for an inexpensive leather strap, this one will do nicely. Leather is supple, not hard, and it looks great with natural finish guitars. My only complaint is that it is difficult to attach at first (holes are smaller than usual, probably an anomaly). So for the price of polypropylene or cotton, you can upgrade to leather.
