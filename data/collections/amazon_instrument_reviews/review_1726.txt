Hard to believe that I need to review a Pick but I really like these picks.  I got a half dozen for Christmas and was thrilled.  I also got one of those Pick Punches (Super cool item if you ever get a chance to get one- it is the 351 style and a standard credit card is dang close to the Medium Fender Pick)  Only thing I don't like about these picks is that they seem to wander away on their own so keep an eye on them.
