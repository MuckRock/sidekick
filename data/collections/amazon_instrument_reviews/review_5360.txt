My son had his eye on a vintage harmonica that my great uncle used in Europe during WW I. Needless to say, I did not want to pass this on to him yet. I figured he could start simpler. I read the reviews of the harmonicas and saw nothing but positive about this instrument. It has a great tone. Its construction is solid. I am sure this will give him years of entertainment. This is not a toy - a great addition to your mouth harp collection.
