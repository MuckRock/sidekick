Almost all of this product is made with very sturdy materials. Can double as a mic or boom stand. The boom attachment is very easily adjustable but also very sturdy when you lock it down. Wasn't disappointed. The connecting parts of the mic stand/boom are 5/8 inch male size so make sure whatever you're buying this product with can connect to that (my shock mount had 3/8in female connector). If not, just invest (about 6$) into an adapter like I did.
