I already had the nickel finished version (which I paid a few dollars more for),and wanted a spare. I like the Dunlop design and price. It should last a lifetime.Glad I got it.  This one is finished nicer than the nickel finish one I have which is rough looking in comparison.The black Dunlop has a nice smooth finish.
