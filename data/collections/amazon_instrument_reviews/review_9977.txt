This arm hold the weight of a ATR2100 microphone fine. It stays where you put it and it works as you would expect. The packaging was damaged and it was shipped just in a plastic shipping bag but it works. The shock mount is the same as one of the low end on stage shock mounts. I did have to slightly bend out the lower bit of the frame to allow it to freely move towards and away from me. However it works great. Not too big and gets the job done.Tip, just take something you can wrap a smaller mic in to get it to fit. My ATR2100 is a 2 inch diameter mic and this shockmount is probably meant for around 3 inches. I just wrapped it with bicycle handlebar padding and it works great.
