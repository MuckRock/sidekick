I was looking for a crunchy type distortion but this is more like a overdrive. I don't hold it against the pedal though. I have a Marshall Class 5 and this pedal actually sounds a little bit like the overdrive I get from the amp, I say this as a compliment. In my case, however, why would I want to replicate what I already have? I'm gonna return it and save up some money to get a BB preamp. You should check out the 78 Badasss Distortion from MXR too.
