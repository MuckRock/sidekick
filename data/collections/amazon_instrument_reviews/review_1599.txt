I really like this over the capo that came in my guitar bundle from Austin Bazaar, so after some research online and talking to friends, I bought this capo.It goes on easily,comes off easily and does not mar the finish of my guitar. Downside, seems like it does not put enough pressure on all the strings. I will play with it some more and see how I like it over this weekend.Let me know if I am missing something about this capo that I should know. Thanks!
