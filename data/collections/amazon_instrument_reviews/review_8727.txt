This is an absolutely amazing Reverb pedal.  TC toneprint is very much a novelty, a very useful one at that if you want to dial in some really nice presets. Where this pedal really shines is in it's endless ability to tweak the parameters using the downloadable editor. You can spend hours finding &#34;Your Sound&#34; or just &#34;The Sound&#34; that you need. High quality chassis, excellent switch and input/output jacks that give a satisfying thunk, indicating your cable is secured.  Don't forget to lift the back panel to adjust the dipswitches to change the true bypass, tone dry through etc... All and all a great one stop reverb pedal with tons of tone and potential that should last a lifetime.
