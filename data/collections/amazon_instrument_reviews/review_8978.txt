I bought the stand to better organize my personal studio space and I'm satisfied enough to consider purchasing a second (too many instruments for my own good).Still, it could use some tweaks: I'd recommend putting lock washers under all the nuts - very inexpensive and keeps the bolts tight - especially on carpet where there's even more tendency for the pieces to shift about under stress. It also protects against over-tightening the bolts that can bend the relatively lightweight metal arms and support bars.I can imagine people feeling queasy about storing expensive instruments on a stand that feels like it wouldn't take much to tilt over forwards, but you should be able to convince yourself that the downward force of the instrument bodies (especially electrics) counteracts the weight of the necks leaning into the top support - making a forward fall unlikely.Still, for sanity's sake, I'd position the stand close to a wall. At first, this causes a dilemma because your headstocks will extend beyond the front plane of the stand. But it's easy to rig up one or two 6-8 inch support pieces from wood or pipe insulation-covered metal to brace the stand against the wall while providing comfortable clearance for the headstocks. Removing any worry of a fall is worth the effort.The design can hold a variety of instrument body shapes; the trick is to find the optimum balance point but it's not hard: I fit an acoustic bass guitar, a 335-shaped Ibanez Artist, Strat, SG-shaped bass, J-Bass, a Martin OM-1, a long neck bouzouki, six-string banjo and a Nick Lucas-shaped Recording King acoustic on it. That said, I don't max out the seven slots - I'll use at most 5, simply because different shapes make catching a strap and banging an instrument too easy when they're that close. If I were storing all electric guitars or basses with similar shapes, I might be comfortable with six or even seven.I wouldn't use this stand on stage - and by 'on stage' I mean any setting with people moving about who might come into contact with it, including a house party, basement jam session, etc. It's simply not sturdy enough, physics or no. But for my needs it works well and saves me a lot of floor space where it's tight to begin with.
