This little tuner is sweet! I put it on my strat-style guitar and it works brilliantly. Agree with another reviewer in that it would probably not work well on my Les Paul or Acoustics, but for the 6-in line guitars it's perfect. It is very precise and accurate, leading you to perfect tuning every use. I totally recommend this product - you won't be dissappointed.
