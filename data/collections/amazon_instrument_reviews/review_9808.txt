I have used this on my Les Paul.  It proved to be very functional.  The size is good if you want a capo that sticks out a bit.  In the past I have used the NS capo which is more compact.  This one is harder to lose because of its size.  I also appreciate the even tension across the strings.  Much better than other capos when it comes to this and is handy if you like to use custom gauge strings.
