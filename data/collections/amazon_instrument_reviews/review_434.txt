This pedal was the mainstay of my effects for a few years.  It really does have a ton of range, although it only does one effect at a time, so you'd have to reach down and change the knobs mid-show in order to get the other variations.  My most commonly used setting was with the overdrive-distortion mix knob at about 2 o'clock, which produces a very professional sounding Grunge-type effect.  If you want any of those 90's sounds, excluding the heavier metal sounds, this pedal will definitely get you there.
