How much can you say about a little piece of rubber that sticks on your mic stand???  First, it a great price - about the same as a Big Mac (LOL).  Second, it fits great & does exactly what it's supposed to do.  Third, now that I use a pick holder I wonder why I never did so before.I do have a tendency to break, drop or even wear-out picks when playing and this handy little device reduces the imnpact of this tendency.  I have some solid / heavier weighted stands that "stand-up" to a quick grab of a pick from this holder.  But when using one of my cheaper /lighter tripod-style stands I make sure I'm careful to lightly or barely insert the picks into the holder so I don't pull the whole stand down when extracting a pick.Great product - "couldn't live without it" (LOL), and it's NOT the manufacturer's fault I have some cheap light-weight stands....  If you're looking for a pick holder I can't think of any reason not to try this one.
