A couple of my friends and I own this pickup and use it to amplify our acoustic guitars through a mixer and loudspeaker system.  Works really well considering how inexpensive it is.  It's very easy to install and remove, but be sure you have a fairly standard-sized sound hole in your guitar to ensure that it will fit and be reasonably stable.
