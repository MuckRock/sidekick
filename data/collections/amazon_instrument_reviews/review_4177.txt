I like it. This is a good pedal for end of line tone adjustments. Like all other pedals, it's not "The Pedal" (seems like you always need another one). But it does add to the other pedals in shaping your tone. After you've settle on a setting you like, it adds a subtle, but noticeable addition to your sound.
