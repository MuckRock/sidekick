I bought these to beef up the bottom end of a Telecaster that came from the factory with a set of Fender 9's that topped out at .042 on the low E, which is just too small for good twangy bass.  I've been using them for a few months now and haven't broken one even though I can bend the high E to touch the D string.  I use D'Addarios on my other guitars but tried these Ernie Balls just for the hybrid mix and there isn't a whole lot of difference.  D'Addario sells a similar set called EXL125 so maybe I'll try those next but for now these are good.
