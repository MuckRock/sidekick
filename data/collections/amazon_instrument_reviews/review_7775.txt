At first I wanted to get these to replace the 3 cheap springs to came in my MIM Stratocaster for it was the last thing I needed to change to have a functional reliable floating tremolo. After installing these tremolo springs (which by the way have a nice flexible tension) I notice that my tone and sustain greatly improved. I did some research and found out there are other websites out there that sell vintage specs tremolo tension springs for like $20-$30 to enhance tone and sustain on Stratocasters! So at $8 this is definitely a WIN!!!
