I bought this pedal to replace one that was not working with my Yamaha Motif, simple and easy set up, just plugged it in and it worked fine, no complaints. It's great to have sustain again on my keyboard again. Well constructed pedal, a nice addition to my recording studio. This pedal works with the Yamaha Motif, that was my main concern when ordering. No other review stated that, so I figured I would mention for the next guy or gal who orders as that caused my some anxiety when ordering ( I hate returning things...LOL),
