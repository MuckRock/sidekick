Absolutely Obligatory for any fan of rock n roll jamming with tastes of jazz influenced rock--1970's influences.  I would probably buy the Phase 100 today though, as it has 4 different positions to choose from, I assume including the original set-up as one of them.Well, I need to correct this.  This review was for the OLD models.  The NEW models have FAR too high midrange and the components are no longer easily modified.  I thought I was replacing an old model with the NEW one, but alas the NEW is not worthy of a place in my effects chain!I will probably get an EH Small stone now, though that pedal looks like it may have been changed lately too.  Sadly it appears boutiques are being bought by non-musical business men who care ONLY about the bottom line and NOT enough, if AT ALL about the sound/quality of their products.  The capitalists have become too greedy, and the socialists think they are worthy to tell everyone else how to live.  God help us!
