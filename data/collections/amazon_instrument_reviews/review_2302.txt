When placing my guitar in a stand on the floor I always worry that someone (person or dog) will knock it over.  This hanger works great for hanging my guitar out of the way, safe and secure.  Yes, I could put it in the case, but when I'm playing on and off all day long that becomes cumbersome, so this hanger is convenient and secure for my beloved guitar.
