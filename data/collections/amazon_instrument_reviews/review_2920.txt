I have many so-called travel size acoustic guitars and have changed out all of the over sized strings that were installed on them (typically 12-54's) with these 10-47's (or 11-52's for beefy 7/8 and 3/4 scale guitars) in all cases, has brought the smaller guitars from duds to nice playing instruments.Three radical samples come to mind: On an old 1931 Gibson L1, the 12-54's pulled the bridge out.On an SX Traveler, you could not hear the Low E until I got rid of the 12-54's.On my Lil Martin, the lower bout started to delam under the pressure of the bridge pull.Short scale acoustic guitars are someplace between a full size acoustic and a Ukulele and in most cases are not set up for heavier gauge strings (even though the manufacturers insist on delivering them this way) due to their short scales, small frets, and light construction.If you can't hear the low E, or you are having problems fretting your strings, try these, what can it hurt?
