I've been searching for the 'perfect' capo for years now and this one's come the closest so far.The capo's well made and doesn't show any manufacturing flaws at all. As delivered, the capo fits the neck of my Taylor perfectly with just the right amount of tension. Some other capos are horrible to attach and grip the neck so hard, I'm afraid it'll dent the fretboard. The Planet Waves capo has a nifty tension adjuster in case you have a different neck profile.I like that slips easily on the neck without a lot of mucking around. Nothing's worse than fumbling around or needing two hands doing something so simple.It comes with a clip to hold a pick, but it's kind of hard to slip one in, especially with some picks I use.Overall, I think this capo's a winner. It's easy to put on and take off. There's no buzzing and it stays out of my way when I'm playing. That's all I ask for :)
