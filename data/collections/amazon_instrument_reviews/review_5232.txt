I have an Alvarez Yari acoustic guitar that I absolutely love. but I have wanted, missed a warmer tone (the body of this guitar is slightly smaller than many and I had always assumed that I would never be able to get the tone I wanted in the low end... as compared to the bass enhancing body of a typical dreadknot style of guitar, for example...).Then a friend recommended I try these strings, and, to my mind, my guitar has seen nothing short of a transformation!Here is the gorgeous tone I had missed!I am now on my second set of strings, and I am hooked.One thing: I have heard that these strings aren't as durable as other strings.However, this hasn't bothered me, as tend to finger-pick and soft strum, and so, this possibility hasn't become an issue for me.And while I would make no claim that everyone would have the great experience I did, I would wholeheartedly recommend trying these strings to anyone looking for a variation in tone.The fact that it is easier on the fingers is another reason to give these a try! Thumbs up!
