I actually purchased this item refurbished on eBay.It is out there for $230 to $299.No buzzing and crackling and NO MORE WIRES!No more shorts in the cables, or stepping over cords.Finally, the technology is here for inexpensive wireless.The Relay G30 has perfect frequency response because it is in the 2.4GHz band like a wireless WiFi router or cordless phone.All the soft clipping is there for every nuance.In fact I don't hear any interference at all even with a single coil.Some feedback is good, but not that screaming feedback loop from cables missing their grounds.I play directly into a Line 6 POD and can piggy back Wah pedals and other effects with the Relay G30 on front. It is just like having an adjustable length guitar cable.This is a professional wireless system.Best purchase I've made this year.You won't be disappointed; it is worth the price.
