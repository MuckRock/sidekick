This is a great tuner. High quality construction. The tuning is accurate. The controls are easy to use and the dial is easy to read. It is far superior to a Fishman tuner that I bought previously. The Fishman controls did not work properly and the tuning was not accurate. These tuners are very handy to make quick tuning corrections while playing.
