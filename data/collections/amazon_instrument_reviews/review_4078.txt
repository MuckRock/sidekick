I have purchased six of these over the last couple years. Why? Because they work. They mount securely into the drywall and lock the guitar into place. I don't think I'd ever buy any other device to hang a guitar on my wall. They feel rock-solid too.I highly recommend and will be buying more in the future.I gave it 4/5 stars because I haven't used any other devices like these before - maybe there is something better, but I haven't seen it yet.~Slick
