This is hands-down the best tuner I've *ever* owned. The Snark SN8 works extremely well, and being chromatic, works on every stringed instrument I own (guitar, bass, banjo, violin) no matter what key the instrument is tuned to. I still use my Korg Pitchblack inline with my bass (also a very nice product), but that is mainly to get more cord length across the stage and still keep my signal strong. This little baby is amazingly easy to use, and always accurate. It has a nice bright easy to read display in any lighting situation and makes tuning a breeze and not a hassle (just as it should be - I've personally always hated those Boss pedal tuners). It simply does its job and does it very well.Also, buying this item from Amazon saved me quite a bit over the local Guitar Center, which is always a big plus. It feels tough too, this thing feels like it can easily handle the rigors of being tossed around, which is a very good thing. Despite the flimsy way the seller packaged this for shipping, the product arrived intact, and fast. I would have cropped a star for a damaged product in that little wimpy envelope they sent it in. Fortunately mine arrived in perfect condition (no thanks to that paper envelope - seriously, they should use a stiff cardboard envelope or small tube or something).I could not be happier, at least until I buy another one to keep at the house while the first stays in my gig bag.
