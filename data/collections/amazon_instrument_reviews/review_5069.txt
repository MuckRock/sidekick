The Samson shock mount does work with the Audio Technica AT2020, yes. Does it work well? If you can securely close the little gap between the AT2020 and the shock mount then, yes. There is another reviewer on here who gives a very good tip on getting rid of that rattle when using this mount with the AT2020. Only other thing is that the colors don't really match up well but I don't really care, its a good shock mount.Ask yourself before you buy though, do I really need one? I don't really use mine since I have carpet on the floors that doesn't like the mic stand shake too much.
