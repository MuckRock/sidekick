This mic is great! I have one I have used from coast to coast to coast to coast. Unbeatable in price and quality. You can't go wrong with a brand name like shure. I have had mine for 14 years and it still sounds like it just came out of the box. You will have no shame in your game with this in in your arsenal. As a veteran bluseman I recommend it. It rocks! As clean as a marsh 'possum.
