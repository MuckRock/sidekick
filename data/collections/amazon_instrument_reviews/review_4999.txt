You can't go wrong with these. I've installed them on EVERY Fender I own. Even if you don't use the trem very often, they help maintain proper tuning if you overbend (which I'm prone to do). I haven't had any tuning or slippage issues when I have these on, and you shouldn't either.Easy to install also, and for the money, give them a go...they're just as solid as the pricier ones...and they're Fender, so how can you go wrong?
