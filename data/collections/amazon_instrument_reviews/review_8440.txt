This is a good beginner or intermediate guitar but if you play for profit get something better. Cheap case but does at least fit the guitar. I like it but I'm just playing for entertainment and at church some times. Electronics are just volume, and tone but it rocks my little battery powered Honeytone amp. Nice finish, nice guitar.. For the money ; )
