Simple and compact.No clicking or buzzing.Perfect for old Van Halen solos like in &#34;You Really Got Me.&#34;Plus, you can get a swooshing bright sound you can't get with a Flange and Chorus when backing it down and playing clean.Play some old KISS or some Rob Zombie.$65 bucks is expensive but a true analog phaser isn't available in most amp emulators.&#34;You know your man is working hard... he's worth a deuce!&#34;
