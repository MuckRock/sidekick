Im sure these strings are fine, I like the cobalt ones a lot they sound good on my Jackson Rose. These however or the high E the Jackson because of how you have to string it would not grab hold of it... Because with a Jackson you have to cut the ball or whatever off the strings I was left with worthless strings my mistake, Just not for one of my electrics my mistake but I do love  the other strings they offer. So im out four bucks oh well.
