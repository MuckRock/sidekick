I could go on and on for days, but the best things about EZD are the endless EZX packs you can add in and the fact that all drum grooves have a mic on each drum as well as room and overhead mics which give you that live, organic sound that you can never get with loops.You can edit the grooves and fills via MIDI if you need too, add in cymbals, etc. It's really, really an amazing program. Best money I ever spent!
