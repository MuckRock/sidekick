Not much I can say about a standard mic stand.  Unless it was a cheap piece of crap.  This one is not.  Nice heavy base plate.  Here is my only complaint:  I went to remove the UPC sticker on the shaft and now I have a mess.  I'll try some WD-40 to get the annoying residue off but for crying out loud, can't anyone come up with a sticker that is removable without a headache? And as an end user, a UPC sticker serves nobody. Why is it even there?  Put it on the box it comes in but get it off of the merchandise I'm buying!
