This is a great little uke for the money... I've bought them for my kids and quite a few for gifts... As many have noted, tuning stability improves GREATLY after the strings stretch in... One suggestion - If you're willing to add a 4-7 bucks to the purchase price, buy a set of D'Addario or Aquila strings and put them on right away... The stock strings are pretty poor, even a set of 4 dollar strings is a vast improvement. Other than that, I love these little guys, and plan to keep on buying them... Finally, if you buy this (or any other uke) do yourself a favor and watch the movie "Mighty Uke"... You won't stop smiling...D'Addario J65 Ukulele Strings, SopranoAquila AQ-S Nylgut Soprano Ukulele StringsMighty Uke: The Amazing Comeback of a Musical Underdog
