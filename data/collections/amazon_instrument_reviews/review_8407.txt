Thank goodness Amazon doesn't sell this gadget for the forty-dollar retail price tag.I just got mine today and tried it out. The sound quality complaints are no joke. There is a constant hiss and any slight movement of the iRig or iPhone while playing will create a loud static noise. Don't know if a better quality jack on the iRig would've solved this problem or not.But if you're willing to tweak with the input and output line levels as well as your speaker or headphone volume settings, you may find a happy medium that you can live with.Still, the ability to carry an amp around in your pocket is pretty cool. If I find the need to really use one of these I'll probably spring for something that plugs into the iPhone dock connector. Until then this'll be a fun toy to play with.March 29, 2012 - Just a quick addendum to my initial review. I've since discovered the noise filter in the AmpliTube iPhone app, and wow, what a difference! It sounds much, much better now. No more hiss, no more static.
