I usually don't use anything lighter than 10s because I think the tone starts to get thin on both the highs or the lows.  I had already tried these in the 10 gauge size, and when these were offered via the Vine program, I thought what the heck.  I have a guitar which I believe the tension is always high and tried these on that instrument.  They do seem to help the string tension issue and the low end sounds (to these 62 year old ears) quite comparable to the 10s.  However, I do think there is still a thinning of the high end, but that's subjective.  I gave the 10s a 5 rating, and, realistically, I would give these 4.5 id I could.  If you're into 9 gauge strings I recommend these, but I'll stick with 10s and 11s.
