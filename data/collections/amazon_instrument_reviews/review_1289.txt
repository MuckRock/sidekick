I'm not sure how much extra utility you get out of the winder.  Maybe if you change strings a lot, then this could be a key part of you equipment bag.  The cutter part is nice, it is solid and effective without being too heavy, yet it does feel well made.  For the price, keep it around rather than tracking down other wire cutters when you need to change out a set of strings.
