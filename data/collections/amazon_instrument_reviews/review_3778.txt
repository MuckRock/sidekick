This capo works on my acoustics as well as electrics and is no-fuss with positive micro-action that allows you to apply just the right pressure by simply squeezing it down after it is in place. Holds the notes securely and with marvelous clarity giving you a pure new guitar tuning at whichever fret you choose. Removal is simple also, just press the release tab and it's ready to remove, no muss no fuss, it really does work that well. Highly recommend.
