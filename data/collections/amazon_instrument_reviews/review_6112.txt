This is my third purchase of this tuner. All three work perfectly. Very easy to tune my basses. One is for my younger son who just started playing the bass. The other are for me (one as a backup).The reason why I gave this latest tuner only four stars is because one of the metal connectors that attaches to the 9v battery is too loose and barely hangs on to the battery post. I may have to tape it down to keep it in place. The other two tuners don't have this issue.Still, it's the best around. Buy it!
