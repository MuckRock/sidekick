I read many negative reviews on several sites.  I can understand how the quality may not be consistent, but as a seasoned folk and ethnic musician, I must say that the set I just purchased is quite good, especially the lower pitched harps in G, A and Bb.  There are minor tuning issues with all instruments, especially folk instruments.  This is what gives them their charm and voice.  I find my whole set to be of very adequate quality and I will not need replacement harps right away, as many have stated they had to do.  The set is quite nice, for the price!
