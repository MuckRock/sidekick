I prefer woven cables for looks. They have a nice stage presence. Hosa has been a very reliable brand for my cables. I don't move around on stage so the 18 feet gives enough length to connect to my mixer. This cable is just a little stiffer than some I have but that's OK for me and I'm sure it will wear well if you move around on stage.
