I had used Elixer strings for several years on both 6 and 12 string guitars. Somehow, I had gravitated over to other brands including Martin and D'Addario.  I got a set of these strings as well as the Phosphor Bronze design through the Vine program and chose to this set out on a Seagull Artist Mosaic rather than on a Taylor, Martin or Gibson. The result is outstanding - So much so, that I am beginning to restring all 7 of my acoustic and acoustic-electric guitars with Elixers again.I have also tried the new Phosphor Bronze strings in this series on a Gibson and had fine results.  Because I did not use both sets of strings on the same guitar, it is not possible for me to really compare/contract the. These strings play as smoothly and easily as do the Phosphor Bronzes and seem to add a good deal of depth to the already resonant mellowness of the Seagull.Elixer definitely still has the edge. Thanks to Bob Taylor and his crew for collaborating on something that benefits all guitar players - no matter what it says on the head stocks of our instruments.
