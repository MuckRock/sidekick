I have a fully-weighted 88-key Alesis QS 8.1 and an M-Audio Axiom 61 semi-weighted and they're both fine when I'm just playing standalone or recording audio or MIDI. But I wanted something with a lighter touch for entering notation and experimenting with soft synth sounds, when my focus is more on writing and software than on playing, per se. The Alesis is perfect: I can grab keys effortlessly without feeling distracted by playing the keyboard 'correctly' - if that makes sense (it makes a clear difference to me).I opted for the 25 key strictly for space considerations and, while the down/up octave shift keys are easy and intuitive to use, I often wish I'd gone for a larger model to get wider voicings. I may trade it in for an upgrade at some point, but overall I'm very happy with the keyboard.
