This pedal work, although I find it a little bit cumbersome in my particular setup. My issue is really only one of cable routing though and will be remedied soon enough. The M195 does perform as it is suspend to although it does play word with my delay pedal, even running the delay on the output side of the M195. The noise gate is quiet and smooth an would be vital to many with a high gain setup. I run mine in my pedal chain for my bass rig, when using fuzz and distortion.
