I have to say I was pretty skeptical about how this would sound but I was shocked at the sounds I could get.It took just too a few seconds to dial in the tone I wanted and off we went.For the money and ease of practicing at anytime with a great tone  is worth twice as much.As far as durability I have had in a month used it 10 times, so far so good.I did purchase the protection plan for $10 so I'm covered for 2 years.
