I have used the Extra Heavy picks for many years but am still searching for that perfect pick. Its strong enough to play metal and some blues style rifts but not so strong it cracks and brakes. I do like the fact it wont turn to powder or fray while playing either but it does wear out fast when playing on heavy gauge strings.
