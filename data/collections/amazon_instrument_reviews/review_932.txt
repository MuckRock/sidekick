I recently ordered a wide variety of picks to find the ones I liked best. These sounded different "gel" picks. I do not like them. Being see through distracts me. They are a little scratchy on the edges. Perhaps a more experienced guitar player would do fine with them but being at the stage where I am still looking at what I am doing - I just can't use them well.
