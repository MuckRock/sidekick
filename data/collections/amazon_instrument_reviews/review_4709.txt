This is a good neck rack for gigging...It DOES  take a little tweaking and customizing to get it arranged right around your neck.But that goes for all neck racks really...Once it's fit to you though, It works beautifully! I use mine  daily and it hasn't failed me yet!Also, it will (with a little ingenuity)Hold a Kazoo, slide whistle and or humanaphone, I.E. "nose flute"  (I do a "one man band" act sometimes...)
