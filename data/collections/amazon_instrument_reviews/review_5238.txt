I use two of these as L/R channels, and my Fishman Soloamp as a center channel.  I use a Rode NT4 stereo mic, run everything through my Mackie mixer, adding some reverb and delay (delay a little of the left, send to right channel, and vice versa), and it sounds fantastic (way better than with just the Fishman alone).  Another tip:  Get a copy of Yamaha's Sound Reinforcement Handbook... when it comes to audio, there are so many aspects that all effect each other, so you really need a good technical understanding of it, otherwise you could randomly mess around with everything forever just to get an "ok" sound.
