I received this as a gift for a smaller pedalboard I was assembling - my plan was to try something different to compare against the Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor on my other board.  While I love the build quality and simplicity of the one-knob setup, I can't say (yet) that I like it better than my NS-2.  With the caveat that I may not have it wired up 100% correctly, I felt that it did kill most of the excess noise, but not all of it.  Good product, but maybe not the best of all the options at the same price.  Will update this post after I play around with different arrangements and get more experience with it.
