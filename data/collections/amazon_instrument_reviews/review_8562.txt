If you need an 808 Clone on the Cheap this is your pedal. Don't be fooled though, it does not school the classic Tube Screamer but it holds its own. This was a main staple on my pedalboard until I found a great deal on a Bad Monkey and then sadly it came off. I was not looking to replace it at the time, it just happened the Bad Money did what I needed it to do better.I recommend this pedal to everyone and anyone who needs an 808 but has the budget of your average gigging musician :).Maxon 808 $150.00Ibanez TS9 $100Joyo Vintage OD $50
