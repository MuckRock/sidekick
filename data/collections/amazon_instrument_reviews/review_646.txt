Well, what can I say? Based on the customer reviews, this purchase seemed like a no-brainer. However, after only 4 months of light use (used on my rig at home) it is toast. The cable barely holds a signal now (constantly need to jiggle the thing to work). And before you ask, &#34;is it perhaps your output jack?&#34;, all of my other cables work with my gee-tar. So it is definitely the cable :(Anyway, I gave it 2 stars because while it WAS working it sounded great through my Roland JC120.
