I bought these picks because the description said they were for the ukulele. I am having a hard time using the picks on my uke. I guess, I don't like the way the uke sounds when using them. It sounds too harsh because the picks are so stiff.But I am sure other people may disagree. As far as the quality and vendor delivery, I am happy and I have no complaints.I use the picks occasionally. Yes, I would recommend them to other uke players. I would like to let people know they are very stiff. I guess I thought being felt they wouldn't be so stiff. But I am new to playing an instrument, and I guess I just don't have much knowledge about picks.
