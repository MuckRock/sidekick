I've picked up a few of these for my various guitars.  I've found it to be steady and stable and it hasn't left a mark on either my large archtop or my Les Paul.  The little locking strap that goes across the neck cradle is a big plus too.  I've seen plenty of lesser stands for more money, so this one is  my first choice these days.
