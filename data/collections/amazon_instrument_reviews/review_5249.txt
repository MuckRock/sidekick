I use this pedal in tandem with my APC-40 and map the buttons to various controls in Ableton.  The foot switch opens the door to more organic sound live performances with a prepared track.  The polarity switches are nice, however the momentary/latch switches are what makes this unit so compatible with my DAW. Some functions such as play and stop are momentary functions, other functions such as track on/off are toggle/latch functions.  Without a foot switch that can toggle between the two, applications are limited certain functions.  I use the footswitch for a variety of applications, in a variety of songs with different arrangements.  If I could hook up more than one of these to my controller, I'd have about four of them, but the one is so nice on its own.
