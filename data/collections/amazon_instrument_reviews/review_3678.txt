The On Stage XCG4 Tubular Guitar Stand is a decent quality simple guitar stand like almost all the others, so here is how I rated it. There are really high quality stand of the same design, but i will not use those stands as a comparison.  Seriously, the tubular guitar stand has been around since dirt.  If you somehow made one that retails for over $30 and are able to sell it, I applaud your marketing team.Continuing on, this is how I rated the On Stage XCG4:If it were over $13, it would have gotten 3 stars.Between $7 and $13, earns it 4 stars.if it were under $7, it would have gotten 5 stars.I hope this helps,~JP.S.  The currency is in US dollars.  Please adjust accordingly.
