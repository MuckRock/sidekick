We bought this rack tray for our son's new sound rack. It is solid, and mounts easily to the front rails on the cabinet. It is a short shelf, so it only goes about half-way to the back of the rack cabinet. He uses it to hold his wireless receiver for his guitar amp, along with other miscellaneous things he keeps in the cabinet.
