First, let me tell you what this pedal can't do.  It won't do long delays.  So, if you're into the sound of The Edge from U2 or David Gilmour, look for something else.  Expect to shell out over a hundred dollars for a delay pedal with lots of knobs and switches that are more versatile.  But if you just need a slapback delay or just a touch of ambience, this pedal will not disappoint!  Analog delay pedals are known to have a warm tonal characteristic.  Users of MXR Carbon Copy swear by them.  But for around $30, the Rogue pedal will get you close, minus the longer delay time.  I've read in some guitar forums that these are the same as the Belcat and Modtone boxes.  The pedal itself looks sturdy, made out of metal.  Compared to my digital delay, the Rogue sounded warmer, although my other delay has a switch for "echo" that made it warmer too.  This pedal sounded good and I have no complaints.  I don't use a long delay time, in fact, I don't max it out.  I only use about 75-80 percent.  Before judging this pedal, please experiment on it's placement on your pedal board.  The user manual advises you to put it before the distortion but unfortunately, it doesn't sound good on my rig.  Placing after the distortion pedal sounded better.  However, everytime I use the dirt channel of my Traynor YCV40, the tone gets muddy.  Now it's in the effects loop just like my other delay.  The sound has better definition.  It might sound different on your amp but at least try placing it before the distortion, then after the distortion and finally, the effects loop in your amp.  Ultimately, you and your gear will have the last say.  Overall, a good deal for the price.  I'm thinking of setting up a smaller board of 4 inexpensive pedals for that grab and go situation where my big board will be too cumbersome.  And if anything goes wrong, I can easily replace the pedals (Joyo, Rogue, Mooer).  Play on!
