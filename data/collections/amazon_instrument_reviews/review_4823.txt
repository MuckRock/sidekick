This was much smaller than I thought it would be but I kinda like that because it takes up no space. It does exactly what is expected of it. The effects are pretty good actually and could be used at a push for live or recording work - although certainly would not replace the likes of TC Electronics or Lexicon. Relatively transparent and controls are responsive. For the money......good value.
