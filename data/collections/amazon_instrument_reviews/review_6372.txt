These  work great! It's hard to write a review of strap locks without thinking you are wasting your time. You have a strap. You have a guitar. This locks them together. But, these do work really well. Compared to other brands, I find them easier to use and that is great after a couple of beers. Downside is that the strap is further out from the guitar than is generally considered (by me) to be aesthetically pleasing. But, this is true for most strap lock systems. So, I say go for it!
