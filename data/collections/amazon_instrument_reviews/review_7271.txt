I'd give this baby six stars if I could. My prior practice amp (a Vox) was very nice, but finally went south and required replacement. I was looking for something with a great tube sound, as most of the solid-state amps that I've used (mainly fenders and line6 stuff) just don't get there. I was actually looking at the Fender Blues Junior and headed to my local GC to check 'em out and listen side-by-side. The first time I plugged a Strat into this guy in the store, I was blown away (and that was with all of the Jimmy Page wannabes cranking different amps all over the store). I've gotta say, part of me was hoping to rationalize the extra buck for a Blues Junior, but the Bugera actually sounded better. The only one left in the store was the floor model, so I grabbed it.Got it home and cranked it up and here are my observations:- It's solid and heavy. It's still a small-fry (slightly bigger than most 15w amps out there), but much heavier.- The construction is great. I think I read some reviews that knocked the construction, but from the handle to the floor everything looks like it's built to last.- The sound is even better at home (without the GC cacophony)- Adjustments are minimal, but enough. The tone adjustment basically takes the tone from fat to sharp. I've run my Strat, Tele and Taylor T5 through this. I think the hard bodies get the best blues tone, but I can get a really nice clean tone from my T5- The headphones sound great. I was really surprised by this. I would have thought you needed the speaker to get that great fat tube tone, but sounds awesome through a pair of good headphones- The price is self-explanatory, but that's really the part that blew me away. This amp would sell for double the price tag.
