If you hate fuzzy distortion then you will love this pedal I had a boss ds 1 and metal zone mt 2 and did not like them much because they're so fizzy they are ok but this pedal sonically sounds so much better to me. it does plexi tones very well on lower gain settings and full on Marshall crunch on higher settings if that is what you're looking for then this is for you. it offers rugged construction and true bypass. the only problem I have had is that unity gain is at around 9 o clock this pedal is hot and has lots of head room props to joyo for this mi crunch box clone.
