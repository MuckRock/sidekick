I've always used jazz picks for my electric guitar work.  Danny Gatton did so, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  These are the absolute best picks I've ever used.  They don't wear down as easily as delrin, tortex, or some other materials.  And, these have a really, really nice textured surface that keeps them from slipping out of your fingers.  I think I'm going to order these in massive bulk quantities and stash them away in case they ever decide to stop manufacturing these...
