Ok reviewing something's I just don't see the need. Ok that being said , I searched for lowest costing 9v adaptor that met or exceeded the am required to run my pedals...this came up first and is IMO all that one would need to run a pedal or other guitar add ons. I dont know what else to say..... The cord isn't very long but not overly short either, I have another brand adapter and it is about the same length and size etc. ok for now that's all I got, I may edit later on down the line.
