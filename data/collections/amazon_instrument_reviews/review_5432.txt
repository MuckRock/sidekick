Granted this is no voodoo laps pedal power, or another isolated power supply, but it does provide clean, quiet daisy chain power for up to 8 pedals, and does so pretty dang great for $150+ cheaper.Is it silent? No.Is it reliable? Yes.Would I use it on stage or in the studio? Yes.Would I prefer something nicer if $$$ weren't an issue? Yes.Does this wok great on a budget, absolutely!!If you're tired of using batteries pick this thing up!If you're a super quiet signal chain snob, save an extra $150 and get the voodoo labs.
