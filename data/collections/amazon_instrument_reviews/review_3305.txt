These have always been my favorite strings, and I've just about tried them all. Everything from elixirs, fenders, gibson, dunlop, and everything in between; I always end up coming back to ernie ball one way or another. Whether it be regular slinky or my ambitious not even slinky *they are a set of 12s* Overall great strings, never had a break on me, last long, sound pretty good too.
