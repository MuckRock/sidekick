I was very disappointed when I tried this thing. I bought it so that I could play along the songs that I have on my Ipod but the guitar sounds really distorted (don't thing I haven't tried changing the settings on the effects/amps). Also is very uncomfortable to use since you are surrounded by all those cables. If you want to record what you play, you're probably better off saving some money and buying the Boss recorder or something like that. Being able to slow the songs down is somewhat useful but forget about playing along to it, it sounds so horrible is unbearable.Update: July 8, 2012. Against my better judgement I brought the Slash Amplitube app just to satisfy my curiosity and let me tell you is much much better. I guess the tittle of this review stands, the free app sucks but if you pay for it it'll be actually useful. I added two stars to the product.
