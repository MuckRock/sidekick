It's a great little tuner, great accuracy, but unfortunately, they are a bit on the delicate side. The first one started working about a week after i bought it. Just broke down. The second one i purchased had a break when it arrived. After piecing the two of them together, i have a nice stable tuner. But beware...these are manufactured on the cheap.
