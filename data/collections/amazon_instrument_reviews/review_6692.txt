When I plugged this into my computer and keyboard, it said one MIDI device detected, but I was not getting sounds from my piano onto my computer. I simple took the MIDI in and the MIDI out and switched them, and the problem was instantly solved. If your MIDI is not working right, try what I did, switching the cables to the opposite side. Sounds ridiculous, but it might save you a bit of time. :D
