I have a rose-gold plated flute, and wanted something to clean it that would not rub away the plating.  This does the job perfectly.  Wipes off fingerprints & smudges easily, and with a little water cleans up lip stuff that gets stuck on my lip plate.  Is easy on the plating and very gentle.  Washes in the washing machine on handwash with no fabric softener and line dries.  Am very pleased.
