I borrowed a friends MXR to try and liked the added sounds it gave me. It filled a hole that was missing . since 80% of my board is Behringer pedals I looked at Behringer first and was delighted when I found the PH9 Classic 90 . Side by side with the MXR , there wasn't a hole lot of difference and with the Behringer's added swirl switch , gives you a few more options. It also is made of metal for all of you that constantly criticize Behringer for their use of plastic in there other pedals. ( I've read a ton of reviews and still haven't heard of one breaking because of the plastic ) As far as value to money spent , This pedal is again at the top of the list. Oh! It also sounds great!!!!!
