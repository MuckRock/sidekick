I bought this for my kids aged 6 & 8, they love it. However it has not proven to be kid-proof. The microphone cable is too fragile and they quickly broke the connectors on each end forcing me to buy another cable.When it's working they love singing and it sounds fairly good - no complaints about the sound quality.
