Fantastic pedal, especially considering the price. Prior to this pedal, I've used an MXR Dyna Comp and a TC Electronics Nova Dynamics compressor. This is low-noise compared to the MXR and simple to use. It doesn't get as &#34;squashy&#34; as other compressors, so don't plan on getting this if you want something other than a fairly transparent compressor for extra sustain and unified output.
