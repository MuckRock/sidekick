I've been using HOSA cables for quite a few years and find them to be professional quality and very dependable without being overpriced. I particularly like the right angle plug. It works well on most guitars except Strats and Strat style guitars. That's still not a problem because I simply put the right angle plug in the amp and the straight plug in the guitar. This cable is far more flexible than plastic coated cables. I'm very pleased with it and recommend it.
