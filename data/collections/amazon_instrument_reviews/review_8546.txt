I have played it with the strings it came with and as a guitarist for 20 years I can attest to the fact that this is a great practice guitar or for taking to the James river. I used to take my $700 Ibanez electric acoustic down to that river and it was sometimes a scary thing. The Ibanez is heavy where this Rogue is light as a feather and it did not cost a lot of money. I want at least one more of these to carry around with me everywhere I go. When it dies i will buy another one. You cannot use this for performance of any kind, but for yourself, friends and family around the campsite or wherever, it is perfect!
