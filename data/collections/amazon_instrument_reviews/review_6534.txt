I am a bit surprised by some of the negative reviews about this product. I have been playing professionaly for more than 35 years and in that time have gone through many amps, guitars and and dozens of effects of all sorts. The great ones I have kept over the years (Ibanez TS9 and TS 10, MXR Compressor etc.) and have put them in a small pedal rack that doesn't take up much stage room. The one item that I didn't have in a pedal form was a good reverb. I have had great success with other Behringer rack products (Digital Reverb/echo, EQ's, patch panels and other home studio stuff). The DR600 was my first Behringer pedal. I think it works great. I have had it for about 6 months and have used it almost every weekend since I got it to play jobs with my band (often several nights a week). It has given me no problem. I can't speak to the battery issue since my pedal board is powered by a "One Spot" multi AC adapter.
