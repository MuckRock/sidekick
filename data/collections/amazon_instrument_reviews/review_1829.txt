I had for years been using Elixir Strings on myWashburn D10simply because I was accustomed to them and saw no sense in making a switch. I'm glad I tried out these D'Addario strings. These strings are an excellent complement to my Washburn, which has mellowed out over the years. They are a fair bit cheaper but has a tonal quality that rivals that of the Elixir strings. I can't speak to the manufacturers claim of "4 times more life," but as of now, I'd have to say these strings are a fantastic value for your money. Highly recommended.
