Fender guitars are made for tinkering -- they are basically just lumber assembled with wood screws. At any given time I have a Fender guitar taken apart, and these little finishing screws replace the pickguard screws I inevitably lose. Don't get me wrong -- I am a die-hard Fenderista, but you gotta admit they are manufactured objects, not fine examples of the luthier's art. That's what makes them so much fun to play and modify.
