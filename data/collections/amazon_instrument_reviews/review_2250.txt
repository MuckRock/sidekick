I do all my own guitar maintenance, which means that my guitars have to lie on the bench with the neck elevated for me to change strings, etc.  I had been using a roll of paper towels for that purpose, but the cardboard tube inside would flatten and cause the headstock to hit the bench.  So, looking around on Amazon, I found this handy little device.  It's small, works well, and fairly inexpensive.  My only quibble is that it could be a little bit more robust.  Perhaps if it were made of metal covered in soft plastic instead of the all-plastic construction.  But don't get me wrong, it's still pretty strong... just don't put too much weight on it while using it.
